_By Dani Babb, PhD_

You know what’s wild? It’s 2025 and I’m still reviewing CVs from clients — sometimes written by other “professional writers” — that are functionally unusable in the current job market. We’re talking outdated formatting, clunky bullet points, redundant course listings, and wasted space on content that search committees skip entirely. These are from folks that aren’t talking to hiring managers constantly to see what’s working and what isn’t.

The truth? Nearly 97% of CVs I’ve reviewed in the past six months (even ones written this year!) would not make it through the first screening at the schools I know and work with.

As the founder of Faculty Job Tools and someone who has worked directly with hiring deans, provosts, academic search committees, and HR departments for over two decades, I can tell you this: today’s CVs require a completely new approach.

This blog is your guide to writing a CV that actually works in 2025 — with honest, research-informed, and industry-backed advice directly from me, Dr. Dani Babb.

## Bullet Points Are Out. First-Person Narrative Is In.

Here’s the #1 mistake I see: bullet points listing responsibilities.

Faculty hiring teams do not care that you “taught undergraduate business courses using Canvas LMS.”
That’s a given. If you were hired to teach, they assume you taught.

Instead, write a short, polished, first-person paragraph describing the impact of your work — not just
what you did.

Example (Bad!):

- Taught BUSU 310: Data Analysis and Decision Making
Full course description
- Provided feedback within 24 hours
- Helped students understand Excel

Example (better, in first person):

I designed and delivered data analysis content to graduate students in a fully asynchronous online environment, using Canvas LMS and weekly video case studies. I focused on building student confidence with Excel and SPSS, while maintaining a 24-hour feedback turnaround and an 88% end-of-course evaluation score.

See the difference? The second version is:

- Searchable
- Human
- Professional
- Results-oriented

## If It Ended, Move It to “Previous Faculty Experience”

Another red flag I see constantly is leaving former roles in the current teaching section. If the job ended in 2020, it doesn’t belong next to your current roles. New hiring folks quickly think you’re overworked.

Instead, create a section called Prior Faculty Appointments (or Previous Teaching Experience) and list only currently active roles under “Current Academic Roles.” It immediately tells the reader what you’re doing now — and it keeps your CV clean and current.

## Call It What It Is: Educational Training

If you’re listing conferences, certifications, or instructional design training under “Education,” stop.

Universities now distinguish between:

- Education (your degrees)
- Educational Training (professional development, pedagogy, certifications, LMS credentials, etc.)

List things like Quality Matters training, ACUE certification, Canvas or Blackboard mastery, and instructional design workshops under an Educational Training heading. This gives hiring teams a quick visual signal that you’re up to date and have invested in professional growth.

## Delete the Educator Attribute Section (Yes, Really)

A few years ago, I included an “Educator Attributes” section in most CVs because committees wanted to see specific attributes in one place.

Not anymore.

This section has become redundant with your Teaching Philosophy Statement and often makes your CV too long. Some CV writing companies are still using it — but we’ve moved on.

Let your experience, narrative, and philosophy speak for you.

## Keep the Teaching Philosophy — But Keep It Honest

Your Teaching Philosophy section still matters. But skip the fluffy language and canned buzzwords.

What works in 2025? Honesty. Brevity. Authenticity.

A few sentences — 10 to 12 max — about your values, how you show up for students, and what you believe about online education.

Here’s an example that lands well:

I believe engagement is the heart of online learning. My goal is to connect students to material in meaningful ways, personalize instruction to meet their needs, and help them apply coursework to real-world challenges. I view teaching as a reciprocal relationship: I grow from them as they grow from me. I do this through .. «insert your methods»

## Cut the Course Listings. Summarize Instead.

Hiring teams do not want to see 15 pages listing every course you’ve ever taught. Not anymore.

Instead, write a summary paragraph for each university or program you’ve worked for. Keep it keyword-rich for applicant tracking systems (ATS), but concise enough that a dean can get the gist without scrolling for an hour.

Example:

At University of Alabama, I taught undergraduate and graduate courses in business analysis, management, and quantitative methods. I consistently applied active learning strategies and used Canvas, Turnitin, and embedded video for real-time engagement. I contributed to curriculum updates and helped onboard new faculty.

This works 10x better than listing:

- BUSU310: Data Analysis
- MGT510: Organizational Leadership
- BUSU102: Strategic Management…

That formatting is no longer effective. Don’t let your CV look like a course catalog.

## Separate “Works Cited In” from “Publications”

This one’s important: Google Scholar can help you identify citations of your work — even if you haven’t formally published with peer-reviewed journals.

Many of my clients are cited in dissertations, white papers, industry publications, blog posts, and even doctoral programs that reference their course design or research.

Create a section called Works Cited In and list these with links if available.

This is an impressive but underutilized strategy that sets your CV apart and shows your influence, even outside of traditional academic publishing.

## Clean. Up. The. Formatting.

If you hired someone to write your CV and it came back with:

- Mixed fonts
- Inconsistent bullet spacing
- Crunched date ranges
- Bad headers
- Course descriptions on the wrong lines
- Junky layout

…it’s time to get a new CV.

Formatting matters more than ever. Applicant tracking systems (ATS) scan your CV before a human ever sees it — and if your formatting is off, you might get filtered out automatically.

My rule:

- University name on one line
- Dates on a separate line or right justified, not crammed into a sentence
- Courses or summaries in indented paragraphs
- Standard fonts only (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman)
- No bold in paragraph text
- Consistent section spacing
- Logical, visual hierarchy

Don’t trust someone who says they’re a “CV expert” unless they actually understand what universities are looking for. Some companies are letting kids (literally) with no experience in higher ed write their CVs. I’ve seen it myself.

## Make Sure It’s Actually

## Me!

There’s been confusion in the market. I \*only\* write CVs through Faculty Job Tools. [Www.facultyjobtools.com](https://facultyjobtools.com/). That’s it.

I don’t outsource my CV writing.

I don’t share my method, except in DIY posts like this.

If your CV wasn’t written by me personally through [Faculty Job Tools](https://facultyjobtools.com/), you don’t have the real deal.

Anyone claiming to be using “Dani’s method” aren’t using what I’m integrating from what I learned just last week from hiring deans! The CVs I’ve reviewed from those companies often have errors, outdated formatting, and miss the strategic insights that come from my 20+ years working with online universities directly.

## Want the Real Deal?

You have two choices:

- Use this blog to DIY your CV using the updated 2025 strategies above.
- Or let me do it for you — and know it’s done right, from the only and original Dr. Dani Babb, with results that speak for themselves. The average CV rewrite takes me 8-10 hours and a new CV over 20. I’m still charging 2001 rates. You can’t go wrong.

## Final Thoughts: This Isn’t Just Paper. It’s Your Career.

CV writing isn’t cosmetic. It’s foundational.

It’s the difference between getting the interview or getting ghosted.

It’s the first impression that gets you in the door — or the filter that weeds you out.

So don’t settle for outdated templates, canned copy, or third-party CV mills. Or God-forbid - an AI generated CV.

Whether you do it yourself or let me help, make 2026 the year you show up on paper the same way you do in the classroom: clear, engaging, confident, and ready.

Yours,

Dani

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

As someone who co-authored the first-ever book to getting online teaching jobs two decades ago and has spent this time helping faculty secure positions, including personally crafting over 3,000 CVs, I’ve seen the landscape of online adjunct faculty hiring evolve dramatically. Through my new company, Faculty Job Tools, part of Babb Education, I’ve reinforced my commitment to staying ahead of these changes by interviewing hiring deans and HR representatives quarterly. This insight ensures I know what most institutions are looking for in prospective faculty.

Even if your CV was updated last year, these updates reflect new trends and expectations in the job market. Here are the latest changes to my CV writing recommendations - part one of several articles. Make these updates yourself or let me rewrite your CV to give you a competitive edge.

And don’t forget—I also offer _job leads and advice_ through my newer, better online teaching forum! Join me and other professionals in my [Facebook group](https://m.facebook.com/groups/onlinefaculty/?ref=share&mibextid=wwXIfr) to network and grow in your career.

## Key Updates to Curriculum Vita Writing

1. Shorter Teaching Philosophy Statements

    Your teaching philosophy should be concise and tailored to the institution’s specific values. Gone are the days of long statements. Focus on what matters most to the school you’re applying to, such as retention strategies, subject matter mastery or building a sense of community.

Gone are the days of lengthy philosophical essays. Show you understand the institution’s priorities and how your teaching philosophy aligns with them.
2. Include an “Educator Attributes” Section

    This new section highlights _how_ you achieve your teaching philosophy goals. For example:
    - “Foster retention through personalized student feedback.”
   - “Promote subject mastery by integrating real-world examples.”
   - “Build community using interactive online tools.”

     Think of this as a bridge between your philosophy and your actions in the classroom.
3. Explicitly Connect Work Experience to Teaching

    Each professional position should clearly show how your experience applies to the online classroom. Don’t assume hiring deans will connect the dots—spell it out for them. For example:
   - Past Role: Managed a remote team across multiple time zones.
   - Relevance to Teaching: Demonstrated ability to engage and communicate effectively with diverse groups, a skill I bring to facilitating online discussions.
4. Streamline Excessive Work History

    If you have a long career history, summarize older or less-relevant roles into a brief paragraph. Focus on:
   - Position titles
   - Years of employment
   - Overarching expertise gained

     For example: “Held various leadership positions in education and corporate training from 2000–2010, including Director of Learning Development at XYZ Corporation.”

     This keeps your CV focused and allows hiring teams to quickly see your most relevant experience.

## Why Work With Me?

With two decades of experience helping faculty secure positions and a network that spans institutions nationwide, I offer more than just a polished CV. At Faculty Job Tools, I provide _expanded, streamlined, and highly effective services_ to make your application stand out. Plus, I’m still personally writing CVs to ensure every client benefits from my expertise. I’m not working with a team of others to do the work!

If you’re ready to join the best in online education, connect with me today. Let’s make your CV the tool that lands you your next role. Together, we’ll take your career to the next level.

Stay tuned for part 2 of updates to make to your CV!

Signing off for now,

Dani

# You Got Assigned a Canned Course to Teach. Now What?!?!

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Canned courses are pre-developed courses that are given to you to change your name, photo, email address and go teach! For some educators, this is a dream. No hunting for a book, editing the course, creating content, rubrics, discussions, gradebooks, lectures, etc. For others, it is an impersonal nightmare. (Heads up: Some colleges will let you add your own special sauce into the class, just find out where it crosses the line into modification, because they won't like that).

So what do you do if you get a pre-developed course and you're asked to teach it? Enjoy the downtime during the creation phase (which often you're not paid for anyway, or it's in the contract but doesn't add to your salary), and find creative ways to get your points across. Schools do this to ensure that the student receives a consistent learning experience, and that they don't spend the first two weeks of each course hunting around for how to submit assignments. Instructional designers often favor creating a master template that gets modified when needed, then copying those master templates into course shells for instructors, which certainly saves time.

If you get a canned course, here are some things to do to begin teaching it:

## Make the Obvious Modifications

Chances are, the course has a placeholder for instructor name, office hours, contact information, and maybe even due dates. Find out where all of those "fill in the blanks" are, and then proceed to do just that.. You may wish to create your own master table of assignment due dates as an announcement too. Don't forget to personalize your week 1 announcement as well and introduce yourself to your students.

## Scrub the Course

Just because it was created by an instructional designer and is a template does not mean there aren't issues. Nearly every canned course I teach, I find an issue that needs to be addressed. Find out if you can make the change, or if it's a more systemic one, it should be handled through the course mater template. You can ask your boss or the instructional designer that copied it for you. Make sure you road test the links, URLs, videos and anything else week by week so your students don't run into issues. Save yourself the last minute stress and your students the frustration.

## Personalization

Just because the course is canned doesn't mean your experience with the students should be. Send emails introducing yourself, share announcements, share videos if you choose, use student names in discussion responses and in feedback, and find a level of engagement that you know will help students master your course content and leave knowing something they can apply right away. I love to find out "why did you take my course and what do you hope to learn?" and then refer back to it throughout the discussions all semester. It's tedious, but students appreciate it.

## Add Resources

Add resources that you find useful. But remember that they need to be ADA compliant, and they need to fall in line with school policy. Maybe your employer only allows open source material from their own open source library. Find this out first so you don't have to ask for forgiveness later.

Enjoy your canned course. I know it isn't "all you" and that part isn't fun. But you can use the time you would have spent writing lectures to engage with learners, and that IS fun and extremely rewarding!

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Many years go, I co-authored the first-ever book on how to get into the online teaching job space called Make Money Teaching Online. In 2015, I authored the [second edition](https://www.amazon.com/MAKE-MONEY-TEACHING-ONLINE-Credibility-ebook/dp/B00Q171RBW). It's hard to believe how long ago that was! Many of those principles still apply, but others do not. Let me run through them and help you see the differences today versus just a few short years ago. [The third edition](https://facultyjobtools.com/pages/books) is broken up into series and I recommend picking that up!

## The Market

First, you should know the market is more competitive than I have ever seen it. I have helped thousands upon thousands of professors get jobs. You can [join my group here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1205281150031252) and see us helping one another, too! There are more applicants, fewer jobs, more requirements, and more cumbersome job applications than ever. Don't despair, I have some tips to level that playing field.

Schools are struggling for enrollment. Institutional health is on the decline (not all, but many). Consolidations, closures, mergers and acquisitions are common. Some online faculty come to me because they worked at two universities that merged into one, and they lost 50% of their work; therefore, 50% of their income. It's a unique market. I haven't seen the same in instructional design (particularly multimedia design) positions, but I am seeing lower salaries and hourly contracts than in the past due to the supply side (many new instructional designers in the marketplace).

## Diversity is More Important Than Ever

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is more important than ever. It's more than just a flavor of the month, this one is here to stay, thank goodness. Teaching for diversity is acknowledging the wide range of differences among students in your classroom. Inclusion represents embracing those differences, and teaching for equity allows those differences to transform how we think, how we teach, how we learn, and how we act - all while being handled precisely with justice, fairness, and thoughtfulness. This is a simplistic view - so read up on it more. I will also write more articles on this. We hold professional development seminars on this regularly, and recommend you attend. Very likely, you will be asked about this in an interview. If you'd like to be on the list for future seminars, just [contact us here](https://facultyjobtools.com/pages/contact) and let us know. We will tell you when the next one is! Don't forget to say you're interested in our DEI course.

## Less Flexibility

Sadly, one of the things we love most about online higher education is flexibility. Isn't it wonderful (albeit sometimes lonely) to work from home and do laundry while working? (only half kidding, I find solace in doing laundry!) Hybrid courses or synchronous courses/sessions are making this more difficult. Someone in academia got the bright idea that adding synchronous sessions would improve learning. Except - students widely report that they don't like the lack of flexibility as much as the professors don't like using their only evening time to teach the same thing they just taught in the online classroom. Unfortunately this is increasing, so don't be surprised if your dream job says "oh by the way, you have to teach two hours live every week. No problem, right?" This may be a deal breaker for some (with my clients, it's a deal breaker for most). It isn't laziness, it's exhaustion. Teaching online isn't for the faint of heart. After a full day doing it, it's hard to get up the excitement and energy to now use your evenings to do the same thing you just did online. This is to "help with seat hours" and to "create a sense of community", but I personally believe it's going to backfire. We will see who was right in five years. :) In the meantime, get your zoom button ready!

## Your CV is More Important Than Ever

If you want one full time job, or ten part time gigs, you will need a CV. I used to recommend a comprehensive CV. That is an older model. Your CV needs to list all the pertinent areas, such as awards, honors, community service, education, college teaching experience, professional experience and so on, but the relationship is more important. How did your job as an underwater basket weaver in the 1990's help prepare you for today? Make that link. Remove the full course descriptions that we used to do. I have a better way now, and I'm happy to do it for you in my [CV writing option](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae). Don't forget your teaching philosophy statement, but I recommend it written differently than in the past.

## Apps. Apps and More Apps.

It's no joke that it will take you 150 to even 200 applications for one call back. You may get an interview immediately if that Dean needs someone NOW! Or you may wait two years and a school will pop up with "you applied in 1997, we'd like to schedule you for an interview." It happens to me and my colleagues and clients all. the. time. Most often you get a thank you for applying automated email, and nothing further. Is it disrespectful? For sure. But remember there are thousands of us that applied to that one job. You have to stand out, be patient, and apply to more jobs. THis is a numbers game, until you have precise expertise or experience that schools need and want. Then, it's more of a networking game. We can [help you with the apps](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service) and are happy to do so.

Now let's get going and get you that job in this new market. You know some things about the market, what it is like and what schools are looking for. Time for Job #1, or #35. Either way, we have your back.

## Understanding Their Journey

Appreciating the Expertise of the Academic in your life. Likely, he or she has spent countless hours in college and preparing for this transition into higher education.. Academic scholars dedicate years to honing their knowledge and skills. Acknowledge and value their expertise, even if the nature of their work may seem complex or specialized. Take the time to understand their field of study and the broader impact it has on society. Celebrate their contributions and be an enthusiastic advocate for the value they bring to the world. While you are at it, try not to discount the work that they bring to journals and the academic community. While academic research may appear abstract or perhaps even irrelevant, it often holds practical applications that can benefit various industries and organizations. Recognize that scholars possess invaluable skills, such as critical thinking, research prowess, and the ability to navigate complex information. You may find yourself asking a scholar one day to interpret something you read (many friends and family ask me to do this all the time, and almost always, their interpretations of the data are incorrect). Help them articulate and showcase these transferable skills to potential employers, emphasizing how they can bring a fresh perspective and contribute to innovative solutions in the workplace. Show them how they helped you, so they know how to present themselves.

## Offering Unwavering Support

Try to avoid discouraging your academic colleagues, friends and family. The challenging job market and the disparities in treatment between full-time staff and adjunct professors may lead to discouragement. Instead of suggesting alternative career paths, be a source of unwavering support. I remember when someone close to me said "you have a great job in IT and worked hard for it. Why are you doing this again?" It's hard enough to get a job, much less repeatedly explaining yourself to others. Encourage them to stay true to their passions and remind them of the invaluable contributions they can make within academia and knowledge-based industries. In that same area, be present and engaged with your friend or family member. Ask your academic friend how you can assist them on their journey. Offer your moral support by being present and engaged. Extend invitations for meals, accompany them on walks for mental well-being, or simply spend quality time together. These gestures of care can provide a much-needed respite from the stresses of job hunting. Stay informed about conferences, journal opportunities, and fellowship applications in their field. Introduce them to your network and help them stay connected to their academic community. Invest in Yourself.

Your friends and family will likely still wish you could attend events, while you are busy applying to jobs. Consider investing in professional services to expedite your career goals with tools such as [CV writing](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae), [LinkedIn profiles](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/linkedin-profile-revision-or-creation-optimization-service) and [applying to teaching jobs on your behalf](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service). These investments can alleviate some of the burdens and prevent burnout during the transition from student to professor.

## Ask Your Academic How You Can Support Them

I hear the complaints from colleagues who are seeking jobs - "my spouse doesn't understand why I am doing this, so I have to do it fast so he/she doesn't get angry." "I can't take time away from the family to look for jobs so please help." "I got my first job and the pay was so bad my friends think I should quit. What do I do now?" It is perfectly normal to question someone's sanity if they quit a 6 figure job for a $1500/semester job working at an online school. But this is just the start. Ask your friend, family or colleague academic what his or her goals are, help them figure out a way to track those goals, then ASK how YOU can support him or her! Remember it's very stressful to start a new career, much less one where your colleagues and fellow candidates are a bunch of doctors! We need all the support we can get! Let's embark on this journey of support, making a positive difference in the lives of our academic friends and family, one uplifting step at a time!

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Hi there, aspiring academic rockstar! I know, I've been doing this for years. It seems impossible to get that very first job with little to no experience, and a "only a masters degree". First, stop.. it isn't "only a masters"..YOU HAVE A MASTERS! That is a huge undertaking and it does have merit and weight in academia. You will be able to teach some masters courses, and most undergraduate courses. You also have some work experience (maybe a lot of work experience), so don't forget that too.

The move into online higher education is a journey filled with new challenges and boundless opportunities. The opportunities are different today than when I wrote the book [Make Money Teaching Online](https://www.amazon.com/MAKE-MONEY-TEACHING-ONLINE-Credibility-ebook/dp/B00Q171RBW/ref=sr_1_1), but many of the principles have remained the same. I update my knowledge and insight routinely to bring you pertinent information to what's going on today. In this blog, I'll equip you with the essential tools and strategies to seamlessly transition into the realm of academia, leveraging your industry expertise and your impressive master's degree. Let's dive in!

Preparation is Key: To kickstart your academic journey, it's crucial to equip yourself with the right tools. Picture this as your backstage preparation before stepping onto the grand academic stage. You'll need a [professionally written CV](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae), a compelling statement of teaching philosophy, if you are interested in research courses you will need a research statement, a compiled PDF of all of your unofficial transcripts to date, a copy of your ID for job applications in PDF format, and a [dazzling LinkedIn profile](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/linkedin-profile-revision-or-creation-optimization-service?variant=45282460729666) where you write about or share articles about higher education or your area of discipline . While I highly recommend seeking the expertise of services like ours for in-depth mentoring and career counseling, here are a few general tips to get you started on the right foot.

Demonstrate Your Expertise: Many recent graduates or "new to education" professionals feel that they need to show their experience in education, yet they have none. Likely, you do. Follow me here. When I write CVs, I notice all the time that someone held a brown bag seminar at work or they held an education-based community event, or write books to teach others something about what they love or know. When faced with the question of how to break into academia without prior experience, I encourage you to explore online tutoring as a first job, or even create your own classes on a site like Coursera or Udemy to bridge the gap between your industry background and the classroom. You won't get rich doing it, but you will get to show this experience. You may also want to contact local professors and ask them if you can be a guest speaker in their virtual or on-ground course. Professors love it, students love it, and you can build your CV! By showcasing how your real-world experience can enrich the learning environment, you demonstrate your unique value and passion for education. It's a powerful way to kick down the door and make your presence known.

Start Local and Expand: To gain a foothold in academia, consider starting at the local level. Apply to community colleges and continuing education programs, where your expertise can make a profound impact. You can often walk into human resources or even a dean's office, confidently introduce yourself, and hand over your professionally written CV. (You've noticed CV already - do not apply with a resume!) Think of it as a stepping stone towards broader horizons. Building a solid foundation in your local academic community can open doors to greater opportunities down the road. Many of the academics I have worked with for years prefer community colleges as the pay is often better than online for-profit colleges and the environment, too.

Harness the Power of LinkedIn: Ah, the realm of LinkedIn, where connections flourish and professional narratives are woven. Don't underestimate the power of this platform. Many of us use this to get most of our jobs. In fact, if you are in my [teaching group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1205281150031252) many of the jobs I post are from Deans who send them to me to share. Sometimes I have an opportunity to send your CV right on, and I do that. Ensure your profile is not only searchable but also brimming with rich content that showcases your achievements, expertise, and educational aspirations. Stand out from the crowd by actively engaging with relevant groups, reaching out to professionals in your field, and attending local networking events. Each connection has the potential to lead you closer to your dream academic position. We have a service to do that from the [best LinkedIn networker](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/linkedin-profile-revision-or-creation-optimization-service) I know.

Expand Your Network: Networking is the lifeblood of academia. Connect with professionals in your field, join relevant professional associations, and actively participate in conferences and workshops (not just virtual ones - shake hands if you can, meet people, have lunch, swap self-made business cards). By sharing your knowledge and insights as a guest speaker or presenter, you establish yourself as a valuable asset in the academic community. Remember, every connection you make could lead to a referral or recommendation that propels your career forward. Don't forget to add this to your CV and LinkedIn!

Craft an Impressive CV and Cover Letter:

In academia, a comprehensive CV holds more weight than a traditional resume. Ensure your [CV is professionally written](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae) to highlight your relevant experience, qualifications, and skills. I have a brand new format from 2023 insight and have used it already with success. Tailor your application materials, including your cover letter, to the specific job requirements, emphasizing any teaching experience or coursework that aligns with the position you're pursuing. If you need [help applying](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service), we can help there too. It is quite arduous.

Embrace Flexibility: As you venture into the world of adjunct teaching, be open to teaching different courses or working at various institutions. You likely won't get your first choice college in the first year, or even five. But you can build a lucrative career with one full time job, or multiple part time jobs that lead to a rewarding and flexible career that is a bit more stable in terms of long term employment (losing one full time job can be devastating, losing 1 of 5 part time jobs is tough but likely, you can still pay the mortgage). This flexibility expands your opportunities and enhances your chances of landing your first academic position. Embrace the possibility of working evenings or teaching weekend classes, as it showcases your dedication and adaptability.

Patience is a Virtue: Breaking into academia may not happen overnight. It requires perseverance and patience. The wheels of academia turn at their own pace, so don't be discouraged by any delays or rejections along the way. Remember, every journey is unique, and your perfect opportunity may be just around the corner. Keep applying, keep networking, and stay persistent in your pursuit of an academic role. Trust your abilities and your determination with a positive mindset. The right opportunity will present itself. I've seen it happen thousands upon thousands of times.

# From Teaching to Leading: How to Transition into Academic Administration (the Right Way)

![University hallway showing transition from classroom to administrative offices, representing faculty career progression to academic leadership roles](https://facultyjobtools.com/cdn/shop/articles/faculty-to-administrator-transition-university-hallway-leadership.jpg?v=1770147395&width=1100)

_By Dr. Dani Babb, Founder of Faculty Job Tools and Babb Education_

Moving from a faculty role into administration isn’t just a step up — it’s a leap into a different world
of responsibilities, language, and leadership expectations. Like most of my blog articles, this is
written so you can completely do it yourself or hire us to help you!

You’ve taught, mentored, and published. You’ve helped students succeed and worked collaboratively with
colleagues. You might have even coordinated a program, led a curriculum refresh, or managed
adjuncts.

But when you apply for administrative roles — department chair, program director, assistant dean,
associate provost — and you’re still using a faculty CV, the message you send is this: “I want the job,
but I haven’t stepped into it yet.”

That’s where most qualified faculty get stuck.

After working on hundreds of these transitions and consulting with hiring deans and provosts, I can tell
you: the faculty-to-leader shift isn’t just about applying — it’s about rebranding your experience to
match what institutions are actually hiring for.

## Why Most Administrative Applications Fall Flat

Let’s start with the most common reasons otherwise excellent candidates never hear back:

- Their CV reads like a teaching résumé, not an operational leadership document.
- The language in their cover letter is focused on students and pedagogy instead of strategic goals and outcomes.
- They underestimate how competitive these roles are — many are internal searches or invitation-based.
- They have no clear, demonstrated experience with compliance, conflict resolution, curriculum oversight, data-driven decision-making, or team leadership.

Most applicants are only one well-written document away from being taken seriously. But that document has to tell the right story.

## What Hiring Committees Are Really Looking For

The jump from the classroom to the administrative office isn’t about your course evaluations anymore. Here’s what deans and provosts look for when hiring for leadership roles:

- Strategic Thinking: Have you demonstrated the ability to align academic programs with institutional goals?
- Oversight & Operational Experience: Have you supervised faculty, managed budgets, dealt with scheduling, or handled course rotations?
- Accreditation & Compliance Awareness: Can you speak the language of regional accrediting bodies or internal policy governance?
- Oversight & Operational Experience: Have you supervised faculty, managed budgets, dealt with scheduling, or handled course rotations?
- Conflict Resolution: Have you resolved disputes, addressed student complaints, or mediated peer-to-peer issues?
- Initiative: Have you led committees, launched programs, or initiated change at your institution?

They aren’t just looking for a good teacher with “leadership potential.” They’re hiring someone who can manage people, solve problems, and execute strategy — often under pressure and political complexity.

## Step 1: Rewriting Your CV for Administration

Let’s be clear: your current CV, no matter how polished, was likely written to land teaching positions. It’s time to evolve it.

### Remove:

- Long lists of courses taught with course numbers
- Bulleted responsibilities that read like a job description
- Outdated sections like “Educator Attributes” or philosophy that only speaks to classroom goals
- eaching-focused outcomes (like student engagement tools) without context for leadership roles

### Add:

- Administrative achievements (even informal ones) — think: led faculty committees, coordinated accreditation responses, managed adjunct faculty
- Key phrases aligned with leadership: academic operations, student retention, budgeting, policy compliance, conflict resolution, institutional effectiveness
- Clear sections for:
  - Leadership Experience
  - Program Oversight
  - Strategic Initiatives
  - Faculty Supervision
  - Instructional Design & Curriculum Development

A 2026-ready CV for administration is narrative-driven, impact-oriented, and operational in tone. It’s not just “here’s what I did,” but “here’s the institutional value I added.”

## Step 2: Retooling Your Cover Letter

Most applicants still write cover letters that focus on teaching, student relationships, or their love of
higher education. That’s not enough.

Your cover letter should:

- Be addressed to a specific dean, chair, or provost (and yes, we write those for our clients at
Faculty Job Tools)
- Open with a clear statement of leadership philosophy, not teaching philosophy
- Tie your background to institutional strategy, accreditation cycles, enrollment pressures, or
retention goals
- Include measurable accomplishments, even if they’re soft data (e.g., improved adjunct onboarding,
reduced student complaints, implemented conflict resolution model)

Hiring committees want to see that you understand the bigger picture. Your cover letter is the place to show it.

## Step 3: Bridging Your Teaching Background to Leadership

This is where most faculty struggle. You’ve been teaching for years — but how do you make that feel like
administrative experience?

We help our clients translate these line by line, paragraph by paragraph — so that hiring committees see
you as a peer, not just a classroom instructor trying to “move up.”

## Step 4: Choosing the Right Roles to Apply For

Not every admin job is the right fit for every faculty candidate. At Faculty Job Tools, we help clients assess:

- Is this a full administrative role or hybrid (e.g., 50% teaching, 50% ops)?
- Is it centralized administration or department-based?
- What’s the leadership structure and span of control?
- Is this the right first step, or should you apply for an interim, assistant, or internal coordinator
role first?

We often guide faculty toward roles like:

- Assistant/Associate Chair
- Program Director
- Online Division Coordinator
- Faculty Development Lead
- Instructional Quality Reviewer
- Director of Curriculum and Instruction

Many of these positions are stepping stones to dean, provost, or VPAA — and they require a strategy just like full-time roles do.

## Step 5: Reaching Out Strategically

One of the most underused — but most effective — tactics in transitioning into academic leadership is
intentional outreach.

That’s why we help clients:

- Craft custom messages to send to hiring deans and chairs at institutions of their choice
- Position themselves for future openings before they go live
- Build credibility through thoughtful introduction emails, especially for leadership-track roles

You don’t need to wait for a job posting to appear. At the leadership level, many positions are filled internally or by invitation. You can — and should — start that conversation first.

## Step 6: Targeting the Right Institutions

You may be leadership-ready — but are you applying where you’re most likely to be hired?

At Faculty Job Tools, we evaluate the hiring patterns, academic models, and leadership needs of:

- Private nonprofit universities
- Regional comprehensives
- Faith-based institutions
- Online and adult-focused colleges
- Community colleges expanding online leadership

We also research what their programs look like, how fast they’re growing, and which departments are
seeing turnover.

That’s how we build your custom job search — not with guesswork or job alerts, but real data.

## Step 7: Letting Us Apply for You (Yes, Really)

Faculty clients are busy. That’s why we don’t just give you leads — we can apply on your behalf.

Here’s how it works:

- You tell us your goals, parameters, availability, and preferences.
- We search for matches (including roles you won’t find on major boards).
- We revise your CV, write custom letters, and tailor every application.
- We apply — for you.

We also send follow-up messages to deans and provosts when appropriate, increasing your visibility even
before interviews.

For those transitioning into leadership, this support is often the difference between staying stuck in
the classroom and moving into a role with impact.

## Why Faculty Job Tools Is Built for This

We aren’t a resume factory or AI-driven job scraper.

We’re a team of real people who work in higher education, many of whom have chaired hiring committees,
served in academic administration, and designed curriculum for national online universities.

We’ve helped thousands of faculty get hired — and increasingly, we’re helping them step into
leadership.

If that’s your next move, let us help you do it right.

_By Dani Babb, PhD \| Helping Professors Find Jobs for 25 Years_

## Introduction: Why Faculty Interviews Are Unlike Any Other

Faculty job interviews aren’t just about answering questions—they’re about demonstrating your educational philosophy, student-centered mindset, and institutional fit.

Whether you’re aiming for an online adjunct role or a tenure-track position, academic interviews involve far more than just proving you’re qualified. You’re being assessed on:

- How well you understand teaching and learning in today’s higher education landscape
- Your alignment with the institution’s mission, values, and student body
- Your ability to clearly communicate your teaching practices, research agenda, or leadership philosophy

Unfortunately, most applicants—even seasoned professors—walk into interviews thinking like job candidates, not like educators stepping into a community.

Let’s break down what really happens in these interviews, what hiring teams are looking for, and how you can prepare.

## Common Faculty Interview Formats

Unlike traditional corporate hiring, academic hiring processes often include multiple rounds of evaluation and a variety of interview formats, including:

- Phone screenings or recorded video interviews to assess basic fit and availability
- Panel interviews with faculty, department chairs, and HR
- Teaching demonstrations—live or pre-recorded—to evaluate instructional skill
- Open forums with students or other faculty members
- Mission-alignment interviews, especially at faith-based or DEI-focused institutions

Each of these requires a different type of preparation. For example, teaching demonstrations demand clarity, energy, and adaptability, while panel interviews require you to read the room and balance your answers across multiple perspectives.

## What They’re Really Listening For

Yes, interviewers want to know about your degrees, your subject-matter expertise, and your experience. But beyond that, they’re paying attention to your:

- Student engagement strategies (especially in asynchronous or remote learning)
- Understanding of assessment, equity, and accessibility
- Willingness to collaborate with other faculty and take part in curriculum development
- Ability to navigate technology platforms like Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, or Brightspace
- Familiarity with adult learners, first-gen students, or underserved populations

Faculty interviews are not only about what you teach—but how and why you teach the way you do.

## Where Candidates Often Struggle

From 25 years of preparing professors for academic interviews, here’s where we see the most common gaps:

- Vague answers to questions like “How do you handle student engagement?” or “How do you know your students are learning?”
- Overly corporate phrasing when transitioning from private sector to teaching
- Not knowing how to discuss assessment, accessibility, or diversity and inclusion
- Underselling or miscommunicating online teaching experience
- Rambling answers with no clear takeaway

Practice matters—and rehearsing with someone who knows what the institution is actually trying to evaluate can help you avoid these missteps.

## How to Prepare: Practical Steps You Can Take Now

Here’s how you can begin preparing more effectively for academic interviews:

1. Study the institution’s mission and student population

Be ready to explain how your teaching aligns with their values.
2. Create short, specific stories from your teaching, mentoring, or curriculum design experience.
3. Be ready to speak to both traditional and non-traditional learners, especially if the school serves working adults or online students.
4. Develop clear answers for questions like:

   - “How do you handle a disengaged student?”
   - “Describe how you build community in an online course.”
   - “How do you assess learning outcomes in your classes?”

6. Record yourself answering questions to catch filler words or overly technical language.
7. Work with a coach or peer who understands the current academic landscape.

## Why Interview Coaching Still Matters—Even for Experienced Faculty

Even seasoned educators benefit from interview coaching. Why? Because knowing your subject matter isn’t the same as knowing how to talk about it strategically in a high-stakes interview.

Our coaching is built specifically for academic roles, with feedback from real faculty hiring committee members. We help you:

- Practice live answers with real-time feedback
- Clarify your teaching and leadership philosophy
- Strengthen your examples so they reflect student impact
- Tackle difficult questions or red flags (career changes, gaps, tech hesitance)

We don’t script you—we help you sound like yourself, only more prepared and confident.

## Final Thoughts: This Is Your Classroom Before You Get the Job

A faculty interview is your first chance to teach. Even when you’re not delivering a formal lesson, you’re still communicating how you approach education, connect with students, and think critically about learning.

Treat the interview like your classroom. Be clear. Be present. Be prepared.

## Want Help Preparing?

At Faculty Job Tools, we offer customized interview coaching for educators applying to online, hybrid, or on-campus teaching roles. If you want to polish your delivery, anticipate tough questions, or practice with someone who’s actually been on a faculty search committee—we’re here to help.

_Dani Babb, PhD \| A Babb Education Company_

_Helping Professors Find Jobs for 25 Years_

Your CV tells the story of your academic achievements, but your cover letter is the voice behind it—it’s where you speak
directly to the search committee. And yet, most faculty job seekers fall into the same traps: vague introductions, generic
templates, or long-winded personal statements that say little about why they’re a fit for this role at this institution.

## Let’s fix that.

This article walks through how to structure and write your faculty cover letter in 2025 and beyond. The guidance here is
based on thousands of successful letters we’ve written at Faculty Job Tools and feedback we’ve collected from real hiring
committees.

## What’s the Purpose of a Faculty Cover Letter?

Your cover letter should introduce you as a compelling candidate, demonstrate a clear understanding of the institution’s
mission, and explain why you are a strong fit—not just as a scholar, but as a teacher, mentor, and contributor to the
department.

It’s not a biography or a copy of your CV. It’s a persuasive, targeted letter that connects your qualifications to their needs.

## How Long Should It Be?

One page, single spaced. Three to five paragraphs. Don’t shrink the font or the margins—tighten the message instead.

## Proven Structure to Use

**Opening Paragraph: Say what you’re applying for.**

State the job title and where you saw the ad. Mention the institution by name. Express enthusiasm and alignment with
their mission.

Example: I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor of Psychology at XYZ University, as advertised on
HigherEdJobs. With a deep commitment to advancing inclusive, research-informed instruction, I see this opportunity as an
ideal match for my academic and teaching philosophy.

## Second Paragraph: Why you?

Summarize your qualifications—teaching experience, research areas, instructional modalities, credentials. Focus on your
most relevant highlights. Avoid simply repeating your CV. Instead, explain how your experience aligns with what they
need.

## Third Paragraph: Why them?

Hiring committees want to know you’ve done your homework. Mention something specific about the institution: a program,
value, or initiative. Connect your values and teaching style to their mission or student population.

Avoid pasting in their mission statement. Be genuine.

## Optional Fourth Paragraph: Teaching or research insight.

If space allows, share a short paragraph about how you teach or your research goals. What is your approach to student
engagement? What is your research agenda and how does it complement their department?

## Closing Paragraph: Finish strong.

Reaffirm your interest. State that your CV and other materials are included. Indicate you’re open to an interview.

Example: I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and values align with the goals of the Department of
Sociology. I have attached my CV and would be happy to provide additional materials upon request.

## Tips to Help You Stand Out

Tailor every letter, even a little bit. Hiring committees can spot a generic letter immediately. Ditto with ChatGPT.

Keep it professional. Avoid clichés or overly casual phrases.

Use formatting that’s clean and simple. One font, standard margins, no photos.

Include keywords from the job description. This shows alignment and can help if screening software is used.

Don’t restate your CV. Provide context and connection.

## What Hiring Committees Want to See

Fit with their mission.

Clear teaching and research goals.

Ability to support and relate to their student population.

Strong communication and collaboration potential.

Evidence of growth and reflection.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Writing only about yourself, with no connection to their institution.

Using vague, flowery language instead of concrete examples.

Recycling a teaching philosophy without customizing it.

Starting every sentence with “I”.

Ignoring what the institution values or needs.

Remember: Your Cover Letter is the First Filter

Your application might be one of hundreds. The cover letter is often the first chance to show you “get it”—that you

understand the school, the job, and the expectations. Done well, it can earn you an interview even before your CV is fully
reviewed.

# Teaching Application Completion Service

![Teaching Application Completion Service](https://facultyjobtools.com/cdn/shop/files/teaching-application-completion.jpg?v=1769716756&width=400)

Tired of spending your evenings filling out repetitive job applications—uploading your CV, typing the same details again, and saving drafts you never finish? You’re not alone. On average, faculty apply to more than 190 jobs before landing a single interview. We’re here to make that process faster, easier, and completely handled for you.

With our Job Application Form Filling Service, your dedicated U.S.-based applications representative—with over a decade of experience completing higher-ed applications—does the work for you. Nothing is automated, nothing outsourced overseas, and every application is completed by a real professional who knows the ins and outs of academic job systems.

Here’s how it works:

- We collect your documents upfront and securely store them.
- You send job postings to our applications queue via email.
- Your rep fills out the forms, attaches the required files, and emails you when your application is submitted.
- If follow-up details are needed, we’ll reach out right away.
- Email-based applications count toward your total, too.

All packages include up to two free job lead categories to help you find relevant opportunities faster. You’ll always have access to your login credentials and a record of your submitted applications.

After checkout, you’ll receive an email from our “Apps Magician” with everything we need to get started. From that point on, applying is as simple as forwarding an email.

While we can’t guarantee a job, we guarantee you’ll have more exposure to hiring managers—saving you hours every week and giving you more chances to land the position you want. As you continue working with us, the process becomes even easier and faster.

Let our U.S.-based experts handle the paperwork so you can focus on your teaching, research, and next career move.

# About Us

Faculty Job Tools exists to make the academic job search process less confusing, less stressful, and far more effective. The company helps professors, adjuncts, and aspiring educators find the right teaching positions through expert job application services, customized job leads, and practical guidance built on real-world academic experience.

Founded and led by Dr. Dani Babb, Faculty Job Tools has supported tens of thousands of faculty members since 2003. Drawing on decades of experience in higher education and as the author of the Make Money Teaching Online book series, Dr. Babb created Faculty Job Tools to give educators the same kind of personalized, strategic support that hiring committees use to make decisions.

The team understands how higher education hiring really works because they’ve lived it. Each member has reviewed applications, chaired searches, and taught in both classroom and online environments. To stay ahead of hiring trends, Dr. Babb regularly interviews deans, department chairs, and hiring managers to understand what they look for when selecting new faculty. That insight directly informs every service Faculty Job Tools provides.

Many institutions also turn to Dani Babb when seeking qualified, experienced instructors. This dual perspective—supporting both job seekers and hiring leaders—gives clients a genuine advantage in the competitive academic marketplace.

Faculty Job Tools offers a range of services including faculty CV and cover letter writing, academic branding, job application support, custom job leads, and interview preparation. The company also hosts a free online faculty community where educators exchange job postings, advice, and support.

Faculty Job Tools remains the only faculty job organization founded and operated by Dr. Dani Babb. Clients work directly with Dr. Babb and her experienced team, ensuring an authentic, personalized approach that reflects her decades of proven success helping educators achieve their next career goal.

![Custom Job Search](https://facultyjobtools.com/cdn/shop/files/custom-job-search.jpg?v=1769716310&width=400)

Our Custom Job Search is a personalized job-matching service built exclusively for faculty and higher education professionals. Whether you’re looking for online teaching roles or on-campus positions, including administrative and leadership opportunities, we tailor each search to your exact goals.

You’ll choose your region (or select online), your preferred type of role, and the focus of your search. Each month, you’ll receive approximately 12–16 carefully curated job leads or direct contact information for hiring decision-makers—so you can apply to open positions or reach out directly to academic leaders in your target area.

This powerful mix of active postings and verified contact emails keeps your search moving forward, even during slower hiring periods.

You can combine the Custom Job Search with our [Job Lead Service](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/products/online-teaching-email-leads?selling_plan=688905486658&variant=45415657144642 "Job Lead Service") or [Job Application Packages](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service?selling_plan=688905912642&variant=45163631313218 "Job Application Packages") for a fully supported, streamlined experience from discovery to submission.

Due to budgetary reasons we had to let half of our departmental faculty go, which included all our online professors. Our dean moved on and I was asked to step in and save our upcoming semester. I had to find highly qualified and credentialled adjuncts to replace the professors we let go, and we had to develop new curricula for all the courses our former professors taught. We already had students enrolled in more than 20 online courses which now had no professors or curriculum.

I contacted Dr. Babb knowing her work and we had a team of adjuncts in place exactly on time. She and her team worked tirelessly to meet the deadline. Our semester has gone very smoothly, and the student response to our new adjuncts and courses has been very positive.

Dr. Babb and her team not only provided a great product but were exceptionally easy to work with. Email responses were typically within minutes, and pricing was very reasonable.

Please feel free to contact me with any further questions.

Sincerely,

Dr. Kevin M. Hill

Interim Dean of the College of Business

# Academic Resume - Curriculum Vitae

![Academic Resume - Curriculum Vitae](https://facultyjobtools.com/cdn/shop/files/academic-cv.jpg?v=1769715959&width=400)

## If you’re applying for faculty positions, your CV isn’t optional — it’s expected. But the way strong academic CVs are written has changed dramatically.

At Faculty Job Tools, our CVs are completely different from anything Dr. Dani Babb has written before. This new process is shaped by years of experience and real-time input from hiring deans, program directors, and academic hiring managers. We’ve studied what works (and what doesn’t) in today’s automated systems and selection committees — and we’ve evolved every step of our method to match it.

Your CV will be:

- Rich with the right keywords to pass applicant tracking systems and auto-screening filters.

- Concise, current, and aligned with how committees review applications today.

- Professionally formatted without unnecessary graphics or design elements that risk bias concerns.

- Structured to highlight your teaching impact, subject expertise, and commitment to student success — even if you’re new to higher education.

Each CV is written collaboratively through an iterative process between you and our team, with direct involvement from Dr. Babb, author of the first two Make Money Teaching Online books — the original guides to breaking into higher education teaching. We also include a carefully written teaching philosophy statement that can stand alone for uploads or be integrated into your CV.

There’s no one-size-fits-all academic CV anymore. Ours are built from real-world research, feedback from hiring leaders, and decades of proven results — helping faculty present themselves authentically, professionally, and powerfully in today’s higher education marketplace.

# Terms and Conditions

Services for Professors (hereinafter “Company”) and its parent company Doctoraly provides various services (hereinafter “Services”) through its website (hereinafter “Website”) at dissertationprep.com, babbeducation.com or another domain, and all services provided are governed by the terms specified herein (hereinafter “Terms of Service”).

1. **General Terms** By accessing the Website you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these Terms of Service, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this Website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

    – Modify or copy the materials;

    – Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);

    – Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Website;

    – Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or

    – Transfer the materials to another person or “mirror” the materials on any other server.

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of the Terms of Service and may be terminated by Company at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

3. **Disclaimer** The materials on Website are provided on an ‘as is’ basis.

Further, Company does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on Website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

4. **Limitations** In no event shall Company or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Website or the Services, even if Company or a Company authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you. Furthermore, the Company is not responsible for any actual or perceived losses due to any of the services on the site from schools, contracts, jobs or anything else that would have provided or did provide the Client income.

5. **Accuracy of materials** The materials appearing on Website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Company does not warrant that any of the materials on Website are accurate, complete, or current. Company may make changes to the materials contained on Website at any time without notice. However Company does not make any commitment to update the materials.

6. **Links** Company has not reviewed all of the sites linked to Website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement of such site by Company. Use of any such linked website is at the user’s own risk.

7. **Client Terms** If you choose to apply to become a client of Company, you acknowledge that you have read and hereby agree to our Guidelines as well as the following terms.

A. **Availability and Coaching**

i. Availability and eligibility are at the absolute and sole discretion of the Company.

ii. Your enrollment in our Services is subject to approval at the absolute and sole discretion of the Company based on factors including but not limited to availability of our staff, your area of study, and your status in the educational sector.

iii. We offer no satisfaction guarantee with regard to our work or services.

iv. You agree that the Services begin on the start date and end on the end date as stated in your enrollment email.

v. If extreme unexpected circumstances arise which impair your ability to work with us, you may request one pause in advance via notification to our team through the [Contact Us](https://facultyjobtools.com/pages/contact) page. However, you agree that any such pause and/or extension of the end date is solely at the Company’s discretion and that this does not in any way affect or invalidate any of the Terms of Service.

vi. You agree that you will authorize and make all payments for the full amount due and that the automatic payments (if applicable) will not be canceled. You agree that failure to pay in full will result in legal action and/or reporting your account to a collections agency.

vii. Any packages purchased do not carry over to the next month.

viii. We cannot guarantee outcomes or jobs.

B. **Confidentiality**

i. Each Party may disclose to the other Party information that it deems as confidential (hereinafter “Confidential Information”) which may include but is not limited to research, invention descriptions, technical and business information related to proprietary ideas, trade secrets, and current or future business plans or ideas.

ii. The receiving Party shall neither disclose to any third party nor use the Confidential Information it receives from the originating Party for any purpose other than that contemplated hereunder for so long as Confidential Information must be maintained in confidence unless the originating Party shall agree otherwise in writing. Each Party agrees to take reasonable and appropriate measures to keep confidential and to safeguard from theft or loss and to limit access to Confidential Information to those authorized agents within the receiving Party’s organization that reasonably require access to the Confidential Information for carrying out the purpose herein and who have agreed to protect the Confidential Information in accordance with the terms herein.

iii. Confidential Information shall not be considered confidential or subject to terms herein, if the receiving Party can establish that the same: (a) was rightfully in the possession of the receiving Party prior to the date of disclosure of such Confidential Information as evidenced by competent proof; or (b) is or becomes a part of the public knowledge or literature without breach of the terms herein by the receiving Party; or (c) is supplied without restriction on disclosure to the receiving Party by a third party who had a lawful right to disclose it and is under no obligation to the originating Party to maintain such Confidential Information in confidence; or (d) is developed by the receiving Party independently of the disclosure made under the terms herein as demonstrated by competent proof. Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be available to the public or in the possession of the receiving Party merely because it is embraced by more general information so available or in the receiving Party’s possession.

iv. Should the receiving Party be faced with judicial or governmental action to disclose Confidential Information received hereunder, said Party shall take reasonable steps to notify the originating Party in advance of such disclosure. Should the receiving Party become aware of any breach of the provisions herein related to Confidential Information, the receiving Party agrees to promptly notify the originating Party thereof in writing, and the originating Party shall have the right to immediately terminate the relationship between the Parties. Confidential Information shall remain the property of the originating Party. Nothing herein shall be construed as granting any right or license to any invention, patent, or other property now or hereafter owned or controlled by either Party.

8\. **Modifications and Validity**

Company may revise these Terms of Service at any time without notice. By using our Website and Services, you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service constitute the entire understanding of the Parties related to the Services. No variation, modification, or waiver of these Terms of Service shall be deemed valid unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. If any provision herein is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid, or unenforceable, such provision shall be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; all other provisions herein shall remain in full force and effect; and, to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed replaced by a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable provision. Failure to enforce any of the terms or conditions herein shall not constitute a waiver of any such terms or conditions, or of any other terms or conditions.

9\. **Governing Law**

These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that state or location.

10\. **Disputes**

All disputes between the Parties arising from or relating to the Services and the terms herein shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with and subject to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at such time by a panel of three arbitrators selected in accordance with those Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and enforcement, as the law of such jurisdiction may require or allow. The prevailing Party in any action to enforce these Terms of Service shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.

# Dr. Dani Babb, PhD: The Original Professor Job Specialist

![Dr Dani Babb](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0617/0060/4093/files/dani-babb_2x_40740814-e8d0-42fd-9ff1-8e65dbf7c636_480x480.jpg?v=1661967048)

Through Faculty Job Tools, Dr. Dani Babb offers / [Academic Resume (CV) Services](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-cover-letter "Academic Cover Letter") / [Custom Job Search](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/custom-job-search "Custom Job Search") / [LinkedIn Marketing Services](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/linkedin-marketing-services "LinkedIn Marketing Services") / [Online Teaching Email Leads](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/online-teaching-email-leads "Online Teaching Email Leads") / [Teaching Application Completion Service](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service "Teaching Application Completion Service") / [The Complete Faculty Placement Suite.](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/the-complete-faculty-placement-suite "The Complete Faculty Placement Suite")

Dr. Dani Babb founded Faculty Job Tools to help educators navigate the academic hiring process with clarity, confidence, and results. Since 2003, I’ve worked with tens of thousands of professors and aspiring instructors to land meaningful teaching positions across higher education.

As a professor, doctoral mentor, and author of multiple editions of Make Money Teaching Online, I bring decades of firsthand experience on both sides of the hiring process. I regularly interview deans, department chairs, and hiring managers to learn exactly what they’re looking for—insights I share directly with every client I work with.

Dr. Dani Babb also leads a community of educators in the free [Online Faculty Jobs Networking Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/onlinefaculty "Online Faculty Forum"), where members post job openings, share advice, and support one another through every step of the academic job search.

Dr. Dani Babb remains personally involved in every part of Faculty Job Tools because I care deeply about helping educators find opportunities that fit their expertise and passion. My goal is to make the process straightforward, transparent, and genuinely supportive—for every faculty member who’s ready for their next chapter.
