Description: Is your institution driving faculty away? Dr. Dani Babb breaks down the real reasons faculty are leaving—and the concrete steps university leaders can take now.

(A Hard Look at What Institutions Can Fix Right Now)

_By Dani Babb, PhD \| Founder, FacultyJobTools and [Babb Education](https://babbeducation.com/ "Babb Education")_

For more than 25 years, I've helped faculty find online teaching roles — long before "remote work" was a buzzword and well before institutions realized how much adjunct labor keeps their classrooms running. Through [Faculty Job Tools](https://facultyjobtools.com/ "Faculty Job Tools"), I've witnessed something that has grown impossible to ignore:

Faculty are leaving their institutions — or preparing to — and they're telling me exactly why.

Many university leaders tell me that they don't have a retention problem. For some, that's true. They've mastered what I'm writing about in this article. For others, it's only because your faculty haven't found a better paying, better work life balance job yet, plan to retire soon anyway or the job market is rough. But we should all want to do better for our employees.

This article is intentionally raw. It's based on more conversations than I can count, career reviews, application sessions, and real-world feedback collected over the past two years. It's going to upset many of you. And yes, it's current. What faculty are saying is consistent, credible, and often heartbreaking.

And the truth is simple:

Most of these issues can be fixed — if institutions are willing to listen.

Below are the top reasons faculty report actively seeking new roles, along with concrete, research-informed steps institutions can take if they want to keep their best educators.

## 1. Synchronous Overload Is Destroying Work–Life Balance

This is the #1 complaint I hear now — by a mile.

Institutions keep increasing synchronous expectations in online programs, and adjuncts are drowning in nighttime sessions that 80% of students never attend or wouldn't if it wasn't mandatory. Faculty tell me repeatedly:

"I signed up to teach online — not host live webinars five nights a week."

### What institutions can do:

- Hold synchronous sessions during faculty work hours, not evenings.
- Make sessions optional and rely on recordings — students watch them.
- Shorten them to 30–60 minutes max.
- Reduce frequency to two or three touchpoints per term — not weekly events.

Schools implementing this through my team at [Babb Education](https://babbeducation.com/ "Babb Education") consistently see no decline in retention, because synchronous meetings were never the retention lever institutions assumed — they were a marketing tool.

If you want to stop faculty attrition, start here. Yes, your students are telling you that they want the sessions - But if you took them away, would your retention change? Try it and see. Many university leaders have told me over the last 10 years that this is more about marketing and less about actual touch points with learners.

## 2. Textbook & Lab Integration Chaos Is Burning Out Adjuncts

Let's call it what it is: integration drama.

Every term, adjuncts lose hours troubleshooting:

- Pearson
- McGraw-Hill Connect
- MyLab / Mastering
- Cengage / WebAssign
- WileyPlus
- SIMnet
- MindTap
- Labster
- uCertify

…and on it goes.

They aren't being paid for this — and adjuncts feel the pain the most.

Faculty spend the first weeks fixing logins instead of teaching. Students get frustrated. Integrations fail. Representatives change every term. Faculty get poor reviews for the poorly designed systems or instructional designers that didn't help integrate the lab for the faculty. And academic engagement drops because much of the course has been offloaded to a publisher.

### There is one exception:

Lab simulations that teach truly hands-on skills (coding, healthcare, cybersecurity) can be effective when used intentionally.

Everywhere else without hands-on experience needed?

Faculty see these integrations as time-sinks that benefit institutions — not instructors or learners.

## 3. Inconsistent Workloads & "Who Even Is My Boss?" Syndrome

Another major reason faculty are leaving:

no reliability, no predictability, and no one to talk to.

Adjuncts tell me weekly:

"I haven't heard from my chair in months."

"I don't even know who replaced my supervisor."

"I'm fully qualified to teach three courses — but I'm only assigned one. Every other semester."

"I applied for a job at my own institution because they didn't realize I already work here." (Yep! Heard it again just this week)

And yes — institutions often post jobs for courses their own adjuncts can already teach.

If you want to improve faculty morale, fix this.

### Institutions should:

- Communicate teaching assignments early.
- Maintain clear, accurate faculty rosters.
- Audit internal talent before external hiring.
- Offer consistent course loads to high-performing adjuncts.

It's embarrassing how often institutions lose great adjuncts simply because their name "fell off a spreadsheet." Faculty wonder why they were ghosted. MANY say they want to leave their profession entirely because of this. Others tell me that they are truly traumatized and question their worth.

Sometimes this happens after being at an institution for 10 or more years. Can we imagine any other profession where this would occur?

## 4. Administrative Burden Is Crippling Teaching Time

This is a rising frustration:

Adjuncts are being handed responsibilities far outside teaching.

Faculty are now expected to:

- Track and chase attendance
- Conduct all early-alert outreach
- Replace advising functions
- Manage communication workflows
- Troubleshoot the LMS
- Provide tech support for students
- Navigate outdated policy pages

Why?

Because institutions are reducing support roles — and shifting work to faculty.

Faculty want to teach.

They do not want to become the help desk or instructional design team. You need them to teach!

If you want to stop losing instructors, look closely at what you're requiring them to do outside the classroom.

## 5. Pay Is Stagnant — and Faculty Notice

Faculty are painfully aware that:

- Their pay has not increased in years
- Cost of living has skyrocketed
- Workload has grown
- Expectations have doubled
- Professional development is unpaid
- Training is unpaid and constantly growing
- Attending meetings is mandatory, frequent and uncompensated

If institutions value faculty, they must — at minimum — offer:

- Annual cost-of-living adjustments
- Fair pay for additional responsibilities
- Compensation for mandatory PD and meetings

Faculty are the lifeblood of the institution.

If compensation lags far behind expectations, they leave.

And they often leave quietly.

## 6. Poor Course Design Is Driving Faculty Away Fast

My work through [Babb Education](https://babbeducation.com/ "Babb Education") has made this point impossible to ignore:

Bad course design is one of the top reasons faculty resign.

Faculty spend hours each term fixing:

- Broken links
- Misaligned objectives
- Conflicting due dates
- Confusing assignment instructions
- Unclear navigation
- LMS clutter
- Outdated content

Some faculty stop enforcing deadlines because they feel guilty holding students accountable to a poorly designed shell. And no, they're not always telling you that.

### Institutions can fix this immediately:

- Use one universal due date: Example: Sundays at 11:59 PM ET for assignments, Tuesdays at 11:59 PM ET for discussions.
- Remove dates from the LMS (put them in the syllabus only). Keep days in the LMS
- Clean up navigation
- Align outcomes with assessments
- Have the ID team test every link before term start
- Eliminate duplicate instructions across pages

Clean design helps students —

but it liberates faculty.

## 7. "Meeting Fatigue" Has Hit a Breaking Point

Faculty are overwhelmed with endless:

- Zoom meetings
- Teams meetings
- WebEx meetings
- Big Blue Button meetings
- Mandatory check-ins
- Virtual coffee chats

Faculty repeatedly tell me:

"I'm not burned out from teaching. I'm burned out from meetings about teaching."

If it can be an email, let it be an email.

Adjuncts especially resent unpaid mandatory meetings — and many tell me they explicitly avoid applying to schools known for heavy meeting culture.

## The Big Picture (And a Warning)

These issues aren't small.

They aren't occasional.

They aren't exaggerated.

They are daily realities for faculty across online higher education, and students feel that their professors are checked out. They aren't checked out, they're just overwhelmed by non-academic things.

And if institutions continue adopting practices that:

- increase burnout
- decrease flexibility
- reduce autonomy
- maintain stagnant pay
- overload faculty with admin work
- maintain poorly designed shells

…then yes — they will lose great instructors.

My colleague and I have been presenting this data all year through peer reviewed work and we will continue next year. Institutions who ignore it will see the consequences sooner than they think.

## Final Thought (And Hope)

The good news?

Every issue above can be fixed — often with minimal cost.

Faculty aren't asking for the world.

They want to teach.

They want stability.

They want clarity.

They want fair compensation.

And they want to work for institutions that respect both their time and their expertise.

At [Faculty Job Tools](https://facultyjobtools.com/ "Faculty Job Tools"), we help faculty find institutions that value them.

At [Babb Education](https://babbeducation.com/ "Babb Education"), we help universities design courses and systems that stop burning faculty out.

If your institution is adopting practices that contribute to the burnout above — it may be time to reconsider.

Because the institutions that fix these problems first will keep the strongest faculty.

And those that don't… won't.

## Page 3: CVs Done Right: The Original Dr. Dani Babb’s 2025 DIY Faculty CV Tips – Faculty Job Tools

Description: Stop using outdated CV templates! Get Dr. Dani Babb’s 2025 faculty CV tips: ditch bullet points, clean up formatting, and write a results-driven narrative that hiring deans want.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

You know what’s wild? It’s 2025 and I’m still reviewing CVs from clients — sometimes written by other “professional writers” — that are functionally unusable in the current job market. We’re talking outdated formatting, clunky bullet points, redundant course listings, and wasted space on content that search committees skip entirely. These are from folks that aren’t talking to hiring managers constantly to see what’s working and what isn’t.

The truth? Nearly 97% of CVs I’ve reviewed in the past six months (even ones written this year!) would not make it through the first screening at the schools I know and work with.

As the founder of Faculty Job Tools and someone who has worked directly with hiring deans, provosts, academic search committees, and HR departments for over two decades, I can tell you this: today’s CVs require a completely new approach.

This blog is your guide to writing a CV that actually works in 2025 — with honest, research-informed, and industry-backed advice directly from me, Dr. Dani Babb.

## Bullet Points Are Out. First-Person Narrative Is In.

Here’s the #1 mistake I see: bullet points listing responsibilities.

Faculty hiring teams do not care that you “taught undergraduate business courses using Canvas LMS.”
That’s a given. If you were hired to teach, they assume you taught.

Instead, write a short, polished, first-person paragraph describing the impact of your work — not just
what you did.

Example (Bad!):

- Taught BUSU 310: Data Analysis and Decision Making
Full course description
- Provided feedback within 24 hours
- Helped students understand Excel

Example (better, in first person):

I designed and delivered data analysis content to graduate students in a fully asynchronous online environment, using Canvas LMS and weekly video case studies. I focused on building student confidence with Excel and SPSS, while maintaining a 24-hour feedback turnaround and an 88% end-of-course evaluation score.

See the difference? The second version is:

- Searchable
- Human
- Professional
- Results-oriented

## If It Ended, Move It to “Previous Faculty Experience”

Another red flag I see constantly is leaving former roles in the current teaching section. If the job ended in 2020, it doesn’t belong next to your current roles. New hiring folks quickly think you’re overworked.

Instead, create a section called Prior Faculty Appointments (or Previous Teaching Experience) and list only currently active roles under “Current Academic Roles.” It immediately tells the reader what you’re doing now — and it keeps your CV clean and current.

## Call It What It Is: Educational Training

If you’re listing conferences, certifications, or instructional design training under “Education,” stop.

Universities now distinguish between:

- Education (your degrees)
- Educational Training (professional development, pedagogy, certifications, LMS credentials, etc.)

List things like Quality Matters training, ACUE certification, Canvas or Blackboard mastery, and instructional design workshops under an Educational Training heading. This gives hiring teams a quick visual signal that you’re up to date and have invested in professional growth.

## Delete the Educator Attribute Section (Yes, Really)

A few years ago, I included an “Educator Attributes” section in most CVs because committees wanted to see specific attributes in one place.

Not anymore.

This section has become redundant with your Teaching Philosophy Statement and often makes your CV too long. Some CV writing companies are still using it — but we’ve moved on.

Let your experience, narrative, and philosophy speak for you.

## Keep the Teaching Philosophy — But Keep It Honest

Your Teaching Philosophy section still matters. But skip the fluffy language and canned buzzwords.

What works in 2025? Honesty. Brevity. Authenticity.

A few sentences — 10 to 12 max — about your values, how you show up for students, and what you believe about online education.

Here’s an example that lands well:

I believe engagement is the heart of online learning. My goal is to connect students to material in meaningful ways, personalize instruction to meet their needs, and help them apply coursework to real-world challenges. I view teaching as a reciprocal relationship: I grow from them as they grow from me. I do this through .. «insert your methods»

## Cut the Course Listings. Summarize Instead.

Hiring teams do not want to see 15 pages listing every course you’ve ever taught. Not anymore.

Instead, write a summary paragraph for each university or program you’ve worked for. Keep it keyword-rich for applicant tracking systems (ATS), but concise enough that a dean can get the gist without scrolling for an hour.

Example:

At University of Alabama, I taught undergraduate and graduate courses in business analysis, management, and quantitative methods. I consistently applied active learning strategies and used Canvas, Turnitin, and embedded video for real-time engagement. I contributed to curriculum updates and helped onboard new faculty.

This works 10x better than listing:

- BUSU310: Data Analysis
- MGT510: Organizational Leadership
- BUSU102: Strategic Management…

That formatting is no longer effective. Don’t let your CV look like a course catalog.

## Separate “Works Cited In” from “Publications”

This one’s important: Google Scholar can help you identify citations of your work — even if you haven’t formally published with peer-reviewed journals.

Many of my clients are cited in dissertations, white papers, industry publications, blog posts, and even doctoral programs that reference their course design or research.

Create a section called Works Cited In and list these with links if available.

This is an impressive but underutilized strategy that sets your CV apart and shows your influence, even outside of traditional academic publishing.

## Clean. Up. The. Formatting.

If you hired someone to write your CV and it came back with:

- Mixed fonts
- Inconsistent bullet spacing
- Crunched date ranges
- Bad headers
- Course descriptions on the wrong lines
- Junky layout

…it’s time to get a new CV.

Formatting matters more than ever. Applicant tracking systems (ATS) scan your CV before a human ever sees it — and if your formatting is off, you might get filtered out automatically.

My rule:

- University name on one line
- Dates on a separate line or right justified, not crammed into a sentence
- Courses or summaries in indented paragraphs
- Standard fonts only (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman)
- No bold in paragraph text
- Consistent section spacing
- Logical, visual hierarchy

Don’t trust someone who says they’re a “CV expert” unless they actually understand what universities are looking for. Some companies are letting kids (literally) with no experience in higher ed write their CVs. I’ve seen it myself.

## Make Sure It’s Actually

## Me!

There’s been confusion in the market. I \*only\* write CVs through Faculty Job Tools. [Www.facultyjobtools.com](https://facultyjobtools.com/). That’s it.

I don’t outsource my CV writing.

I don’t share my method, except in DIY posts like this.

If your CV wasn’t written by me personally through [Faculty Job Tools](https://facultyjobtools.com/), you don’t have the real deal.

Anyone claiming to be using “Dani’s method” aren’t using what I’m integrating from what I learned just last week from hiring deans! The CVs I’ve reviewed from those companies often have errors, outdated formatting, and miss the strategic insights that come from my 20+ years working with online universities directly.

## Want the Real Deal?

You have two choices:

- Use this blog to DIY your CV using the updated 2025 strategies above.
- Or let me do it for you — and know it’s done right, from the only and original Dr. Dani Babb, with results that speak for themselves. The average CV rewrite takes me 8-10 hours and a new CV over 20. I’m still charging 2001 rates. You can’t go wrong.

## Final Thoughts: This Isn’t Just Paper. It’s Your Career.

CV writing isn’t cosmetic. It’s foundational.

It’s the difference between getting the interview or getting ghosted.

It’s the first impression that gets you in the door — or the filter that weeds you out.

So don’t settle for outdated templates, canned copy, or third-party CV mills. Or God-forbid - an AI generated CV.

Whether you do it yourself or let me help, make 2026 the year you show up on paper the same way you do in the classroom: clear, engaging, confident, and ready.

Yours,

Dani

Visit Faculty Job Tools to get hired faster and stand out in the competitive online education market.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

As someone who co-authored the first-ever book to getting online teaching jobs two decades ago and has spent this time helping faculty secure positions, including personally crafting over 3,000 CVs, I’ve seen the landscape of online adjunct faculty hiring evolve dramatically. Through my new company, Faculty Job Tools, part of Babb Education, I’ve reinforced my commitment to staying ahead of these changes by interviewing hiring deans and HR representatives quarterly. This insight ensures I know what most institutions are looking for in prospective faculty.

Even if your CV was updated last year, these updates reflect new trends and expectations in the job market. Here are the latest changes to my CV writing recommendations - part one of several articles. Make these updates yourself or let me rewrite your CV to give you a competitive edge.

And don’t forget—I also offer _job leads and advice_ through my newer, better online teaching forum! Join me and other professionals in my [Facebook group](https://m.facebook.com/groups/onlinefaculty/?ref=share&mibextid=wwXIfr) to network and grow in your career.

## Key Updates to Curriculum Vita Writing

1. Shorter Teaching Philosophy Statements

    Your teaching philosophy should be concise and tailored to the institution’s specific values. Gone are the days of long statements. Focus on what matters most to the school you’re applying to, such as retention strategies, subject matter mastery or building a sense of community.

Gone are the days of lengthy philosophical essays. Show you understand the institution’s priorities and how your teaching philosophy aligns with them.
2. Include an “Educator Attributes” Section

    This new section highlights _how_ you achieve your teaching philosophy goals. For example:
    - “Foster retention through personalized student feedback.”
   - “Promote subject mastery by integrating real-world examples.”
   - “Build community using interactive online tools.”

     Think of this as a bridge between your philosophy and your actions in the classroom.
3. Explicitly Connect Work Experience to Teaching

    Each professional position should clearly show how your experience applies to the online classroom. Don’t assume hiring deans will connect the dots—spell it out for them. For example:
   - Past Role: Managed a remote team across multiple time zones.
   - Relevance to Teaching: Demonstrated ability to engage and communicate effectively with diverse groups, a skill I bring to facilitating online discussions.
4. Streamline Excessive Work History

    If you have a long career history, summarize older or less-relevant roles into a brief paragraph. Focus on:
   - Position titles
   - Years of employment
   - Overarching expertise gained

     For example: “Held various leadership positions in education and corporate training from 2000–2010, including Director of Learning Development at XYZ Corporation.”

     This keeps your CV focused and allows hiring teams to quickly see your most relevant experience.

At Faculty Job Tools, I provide _expanded, streamlined, and highly effective services_ to make your application stand out.

## Page 5: You Got Assigned a Canned Course to Teach. Now What?!?! – Faculty Job Tools
URL: https://facultyjobtools.com/blogs/news/you-got-assigned-a-canned-course-to-teach-now-what
Date: 2026-02-03
Description: Discover strategies for teaching canned courses. Modify, personalize, engage! Here are tips for teaching pre-developed courses effectively.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Canned courses are pre-developed courses that are given to you to change your name, photo, email address and go teach! For some educators, this is a dream. No hunting for a book, editing the course, creating content, rubrics, discussions, gradebooks, lectures, etc. For others, it is an impersonal nightmare. (Heads up: Some colleges will let you add your own special sauce into the class, just find out where it crosses the line into modification, because they won't like that).

So what do you do if you get a pre-developed course and you're asked to teach it? Enjoy the downtime during the creation phase (which often you're not paid for anyway, or it's in the contract but doesn't add to your salary), and find creative ways to get your points across. Schools do this to ensure that the student receives a consistent learning experience, and that they don't spend the first two weeks of each course hunting around for how to submit assignments. Instructional designers often favor creating a master template that gets modified when needed, then copying those master templates into course shells for instructors, which certainly saves time.

If you get a canned course, here are some things to do to begin teaching it:

## Make the Obvious Modifications

Chances are, the course has a placeholder for instructor name, office hours, contact information, and maybe even due dates. Find out where all of those "fill in the blanks" are, and then proceed to do just that.. You may wish to create your own master table of assignment due dates as an announcement too. Don't forget to personalize your week 1 announcement as well and introduce yourself to your students.

## Scrub the Course

Just because it was created by an instructional designer and is a template does not mean there aren't issues. Nearly every canned course I teach, I find an issue that needs to be addressed. Find out if you can make the change, or if it's a more systemic one, it should be handled through the course mater template. You can ask your boss or the instructional designer that copied it for you. Make sure you road test the links, URLs, videos and anything else week by week so your students don't run into issues. Save yourself the last minute stress and your students the frustration.

## Personalization

Just because the course is canned doesn't mean your experience with the students should be. Send emails introducing yourself, share announcements, share videos if you choose, use student names in discussion responses and in feedback, and find a level of engagement that you know will help students master your course content and leave knowing something they can apply right away. I love to find out "why did you take my course and what do you hope to learn?" and then refer back to it throughout the discussions all semester. It's tedious, but students appreciate it.

## Add Resources

Add resources that you find useful. But remember that they need to be ADA compliant, and they need to fall in line with school policy. Maybe your employer only allows open source material from their own open source library. Find this out first so you don't have to ask for forgiveness later.

Enjoy your canned course. I know it isn't "all you" and that part isn't fun. But you can use the time you would have spent writing lectures to engage with learners, and that IS fun and extremely rewarding!

## Page 6: What's Different In The Online Teaching Job Market Today Than 5 Years – Faculty Job Tools
URL: https://facultyjobtools.com/blogs/news/whats-different-in-the-online-teaching-job-market-today-than-5-years-ago
Date: 2026-02-03
Description: The online teaching job market has become highly competitive with fewer positions available. Employers prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion. Flexibility is decreasing due to the rise of hybrid courses. A strong CV is essential. Applicants must be persistent in their job search. We can help you with this.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Many years go, I co-authored the first-ever book on how to get into the online teaching job space called Make Money Teaching Online. In 2015, I authored the [second edition](https://www.amazon.com/MAKE-MONEY-TEACHING-ONLINE-Credibility-ebook/dp/B00Q171RBW). It's hard to believe how long ago that was! Many of those principles still apply, but others do not. Let me run through them and help you see the differences today versus just a few short years ago. [The third edition](https://facultyjobtools.com/pages/books) is broken up into series and I recommend picking that up!

## The Market

First, you should know the market is more competitive than I have ever seen it. I have helped thousands upon thousands of professors get jobs. You can [join my group here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1205281150031252) and see us helping one another, too! There are more applicants, fewer jobs, more requirements, and more cumbersome job applications than ever. Don't despair, I have some tips to level that playing field.

Schools are struggling for enrollment. Institutional health is on the decline (not all, but many). Consolidations, closures, mergers and acquisitions are common. Some online faculty come to me because they worked at two universities that merged into one, and they lost 50% of their work; therefore, 50% of their income. It's a unique market. I haven't seen the same in instructional design (particularly multimedia design) positions, but I am seeing lower salaries and hourly contracts than in the past due to the supply side (many new instructional designers in the marketplace).

## Diversity is More Important Than Ever

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is more important than ever. It's more than just a flavor of the month, this one is here to stay, thank goodness. Teaching for diversity is acknowledging the wide range of differences among students in your classroom. Inclusion represents embracing those differences, and teaching for equity allows those differences to transform how we think, how we teach, how we learn, and how we act - all while being handled precisely with justice, fairness, and thoughtfulness. This is a simplistic view - so read up on it more. I will also write more articles on this. We hold professional development seminars on this regularly, and recommend you attend. Very likely, you will be asked about this in an interview. If you'd like to be on the list for future seminars, just [contact us here](https://facultyjobtools.com/pages/contact) and let us know. We will tell you when the next one is! Don't forget to say you're interested in our DEI course.

## Less Flexibility

Sadly, one of the things we love most about online higher education is flexibility. Isn't it wonderful (albeit sometimes lonely) to work from home and do laundry while working? (only half kidding, I find solace in doing laundry!) Hybrid courses or synchronous courses/sessions are making this more difficult. Someone in academia got the bright idea that adding synchronous sessions would improve learning. Except - students widely report that they don't like the lack of flexibility as much as the professors don't like using their only evening time to teach the same thing they just taught in the online classroom. Unfortunately this is increasing, so don't be surprised if your dream job says "oh by the way, you have to teach two hours live every week. No problem, right?" This may be a deal breaker for some (with my clients, it's a deal breaker for most). It isn't laziness, it's exhaustion. Teaching online isn't for the faint of heart. After a full day doing it, it's hard to get up the excitement and energy to now use your evenings to do the same thing you just did online. This is to "help with seat hours" and to "create a sense of community", but I personally believe it's going to backfire. We will see who was right in five years. :) In the meantime, get your zoom button ready!

## Your CV is More Important Than Ever

If you want one full time job, or ten part time gigs, you will need a CV. I used to recommend a comprehensive CV. That is an older model. Your CV needs to list all the pertinent areas, such as awards, honors, community service, education, college teaching experience, professional experience and so on, but the relationship is more important. How did your job as an underwater basket weaver in the 1990's help prepare you for today? Make that link. Remove the full course descriptions that we used to do. I have a better way now, and I'm happy to do it for you in my [CV writing option](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae). Don't forget your teaching philosophy statement, but I recommend it written differently than in the past.

## Apps. Apps and More Apps.

It's no joke that it will take you 150 to even 200 applications for one call back. You may get an interview immediately if that Dean needs someone NOW! Or you may wait two years and a school will pop up with "you applied in 1997, we'd like to schedule you for an interview." It happens to me and my colleagues and clients all. the. time. Most often you get a thank you for applying automated email, and nothing further. Is it disrespectful? For sure. But remember there are thousands of us that applied to that one job. You have to stand out, be patient, and apply to more jobs. THis is a numbers game, until you have precise expertise or experience that schools need and want. Then, it's more of a networking game. We can [help you with the apps](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service) and are happy to do so.

Now let's get going and get you that job in this new market. You know some things about the market, what it is like and what schools are looking for. Time for Job #1, or #35. Either way, we have your back.

## Understanding Their Journey

Appreciating the Expertise of the Academic in your life. Likely, he or she has spent countless hours in college and preparing for this transition into higher education.. Academic scholars dedicate years to honing their knowledge and skills. Acknowledge and value their expertise, even if the nature of their work may seem complex or specialized. Take the time to understand their field of study and the broader impact it has on society. Celebrate their contributions and be an enthusiastic advocate for the value they bring to the world. While you are at it, try not to discount the work that they bring to journals and the academic community. While academic research may appear abstract or perhaps even irrelevant, it often holds practical applications that can benefit various industries and organizations. Recognize that scholars possess invaluable skills, such as critical thinking, research prowess, and the ability to navigate complex information. You may find yourself asking a scholar one day to interpret something you read (many friends and family ask me to do this all the time, and almost always, their interpretations of the data are incorrect). Help them articulate and showcase these transferable skills to potential employers, emphasizing how they can bring a fresh perspective and contribute to innovative solutions in the workplace. Show them how they helped you, so they know how to present themselves.

## Offering Unwavering Support

Try to avoid discouraging your academic colleagues, friends and family. The challenging job market and the disparities in treatment between full-time staff and adjunct professors may lead to discouragement. Instead of suggesting alternative career paths, be a source of unwavering support. I remember when someone close to me said "you have a great job in IT and worked hard for it. Why are you doing this again?" It's hard enough to get a job, much less repeatedly explaining yourself to others. Encourage them to stay true to their passions and remind them of the invaluable contributions they can make within academia and knowledge-based industries. In that same area, be present and engaged with your friend or family member. Ask your academic friend how you can assist them on their journey. Offer your moral support by being present and engaged. Extend invitations for meals, accompany them on walks for mental well-being, or simply spend quality time together. These gestures of care can provide a much-needed respite from the stresses of job hunting. Stay informed about conferences, journal opportunities, and fellowship applications in their field. Introduce them to your network and help them stay connected to their academic community. Invest in Yourself.

Your friends and family will likely still wish you could attend events, while you are busy applying to jobs. Consider investing in professional services to expedite your career goals with tools such as [CV writing](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae), [LinkedIn profiles](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/linkedin-profile-revision-or-creation-optimization-service) and [applying to teaching jobs on your behalf](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service). These investments can alleviate some of the burdens and prevent burnout during the transition from student to professor.

## Ask Your Academic How You Can Support Them

I hear the complaints from colleagues who are seeking jobs - "my spouse doesn't understand why I am doing this, so I have to do it fast so he/she doesn't get angry." "I can't take time away from the family to look for jobs so please help." "I got my first job and the pay was so bad my friends think I should quit. What do I do now?" It is perfectly normal to question someone's sanity if they quit a 6 figure job for a $1500/semester job working at an online school. But this is just the start. Ask your friend, family or colleague academic what his or her goals are, help them figure out a way to track those goals, then ASK how YOU can support him or her! Remember it's very stressful to start a new career, much less one where your colleagues and fellow candidates are a bunch of doctors! We need all the support we can get! Let's embark on this journey of support, making a positive difference in the lives of our academic friends and family, one uplifting step at a time!

## Page 8: How to Get Your First Online Teaching Job with a Masters Degree and Li – Faculty Job Tools

Description: Practical information to become an online professor or get work as an online faculty member with a masters degree. Learn strategies to get your first job in online higher education and start your rewarding career in online education today.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Hi there, aspiring academic rockstar! I know, I've been doing this for years. It seems impossible to get that very first job with little to no experience, and a "only a masters degree". First, stop.. it isn't "only a masters"..YOU HAVE A MASTERS! That is a huge undertaking and it does have merit and weight in academia. You will be able to teach some masters courses, and most undergraduate courses. You also have some work experience (maybe a lot of work experience), so don't forget that too.

The move into online higher education is a journey filled with new challenges and boundless opportunities. The opportunities are different today than when I wrote the book [Make Money Teaching Online](https://www.amazon.com/MAKE-MONEY-TEACHING-ONLINE-Credibility-ebook/dp/B00Q171RBW/ref=sr_1_1), but many of the principles have remained the same. I update my knowledge and insight routinely to bring you pertinent information to what's going on today. In this blog, I'll equip you with the essential tools and strategies to seamlessly transition into the realm of academia, leveraging your industry expertise and your impressive master's degree. Let's dive in!

Preparation is Key: To kickstart your academic journey, it's crucial to equip yourself with the right tools. Picture this as your backstage preparation before stepping onto the grand academic stage. You'll need a [professionally written CV](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae), a compelling statement of teaching philosophy, if you are interested in research courses you will need a research statement, a compiled PDF of all of your unofficial transcripts to date, a copy of your ID for job applications in PDF format, and a [dazzling LinkedIn profile](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/linkedin-profile-revision-or-creation-optimization-service?variant=45282460729666) where you write about or share articles about higher education or your area of discipline . While I highly recommend seeking the expertise of services like ours for in-depth mentoring and career counseling, here are a few general tips to get you started on the right foot.

Demonstrate Your Expertise: Many recent graduates or "new to education" professionals feel that they need to show their experience in education, yet they have none. Likely, you do. Follow me here. When I write CVs, I notice all the time that someone held a brown bag seminar at work or they held an education-based community event, or write books to teach others something about what they love or know. When faced with the question of how to break into academia without prior experience, I encourage you to explore online tutoring as a first job, or even create your own classes on a site like Coursera or Udemy to bridge the gap between your industry background and the classroom. You won't get rich doing it, but you will get to show this experience. You may also want to contact local professors and ask them if you can be a guest speaker in their virtual or on-ground course. Professors love it, students love it, and you can build your CV! By showcasing how your real-world experience can enrich the learning environment, you demonstrate your unique value and passion for education. It's a powerful way to kick down the door and make your presence known.

Start Local and Expand: To gain a foothold in academia, consider starting at the local level. Apply to community colleges and continuing education programs, where your expertise can make a profound impact. You can often walk into human resources or even a dean's office, confidently introduce yourself, and hand over your professionally written CV. (You've noticed CV already - do not apply with a resume!) Think of it as a stepping stone towards broader horizons. Building a solid foundation in your local academic community can open doors to greater opportunities down the road. Many of the academics I have worked with for years prefer community colleges as the pay is often better than online for-profit colleges and the environment, too.

Harness the Power of LinkedIn: Ah, the realm of LinkedIn, where connections flourish and professional narratives are woven. Don't underestimate the power of this platform. Many of us use this to get most of our jobs. In fact, if you are in my [teaching group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1205281150031252) many of the jobs I post are from Deans who send them to me to share. Sometimes I have an opportunity to send your CV right on, and I do that. Ensure your profile is not only searchable but also brimming with rich content that showcases your achievements, expertise, and educational aspirations. Stand out from the crowd by actively engaging with relevant groups, reaching out to professionals in your field, and attending local networking events. Each connection has the potential to lead you closer to your dream academic position. We have a service to do that from the [best LinkedIn networker](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/linkedin-profile-revision-or-creation-optimization-service) I know.

Expand Your Network: Networking is the lifeblood of academia. Connect with professionals in your field, join relevant professional associations, and actively participate in conferences and workshops (not just virtual ones - shake hands if you can, meet people, have lunch, swap self-made business cards). By sharing your knowledge and insights as a guest speaker or presenter, you establish yourself as a valuable asset in the academic community. Remember, every connection you make could lead to a referral or recommendation that propels your career forward. Don't forget to add this to your CV and LinkedIn!

Craft an Impressive CV and Cover Letter:

In academia, a comprehensive CV holds more weight than a traditional resume. Ensure your [CV is professionally written](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/academic-resume-curriculum-vitae) to highlight your relevant experience, qualifications, and skills. I have a brand new format from 2023 insight and have used it already with success. Tailor your application materials, including your cover letter, to the specific job requirements, emphasizing any teaching experience or coursework that aligns with the position you're pursuing. If you need [help applying](https://facultyjobtools.com/products/teaching-application-completion-service), we can help there too. It is quite arduous.

Embrace Flexibility: As you venture into the world of adjunct teaching, be open to teaching different courses or working at various institutions. You likely won't get your first choice college in the first year, or even five. But you can build a lucrative career with one full time job, or multiple part time jobs that lead to a rewarding and flexible career that is a bit more stable in terms of long term employment (losing one full time job can be devastating, losing 1 of 5 part time jobs is tough but likely, you can still pay the mortgage). This flexibility expands your opportunities and enhances your chances of landing your first academic position. Embrace the possibility of working evenings or teaching weekend classes, as it showcases your dedication and adaptability.

Patience is a Virtue: Breaking into academia may not happen overnight. It requires perseverance and patience. The wheels of academia turn at their own pace, so don't be discouraged by any delays or rejections along the way. Remember, every journey is unique, and your perfect opportunity may be just around the corner. Keep applying, keep networking, and stay persistent in your pursuit of an academic role. Trust your abilities and your determination with a positive mindset. The right opportunity will present itself. I've seen it happen thousands upon thousands of times.

## Page 9: From Teaching to Leading: How to Transition into Academic Administrati – Faculty Job Tools
URL: https://facultyjobtools.com/blogs/news/from-teaching-to-leading-how-to-transition-into-academic-administration-the-right-way
Date: 2026-02-03
Description: Learn how to transition from faculty to academic administration with strategic CV rewriting, leadership positioning, and targeted applications. Expert guidance for department chair, program director, and dean roles.

_By Dr. Dani Babb, Founder of Faculty Job Tools and Babb Education_

Moving from a faculty role into administration isn’t just a step up — it’s a leap into a different world
of responsibilities, language, and leadership expectations. Like most of my blog articles, this is
written so you can completely do it yourself or hire us to help you!

You’ve taught, mentored, and published. You’ve helped students succeed and worked collaboratively with
colleagues. You might have even coordinated a program, led a curriculum refresh, or managed
adjuncts.

But when you apply for administrative roles — department chair, program director, assistant dean,
associate provost — and you’re still using a faculty CV, the message you send is this: “I want the job,
but I haven’t stepped into it yet.”

That’s where most qualified faculty get stuck.

After working on hundreds of these transitions and consulting with hiring deans and provosts, I can tell
you: the faculty-to-leader shift isn’t just about applying — it’s about rebranding your experience to
match what institutions are actually hiring for.

## Why Most Administrative Applications Fall Flat

Let’s start with the most common reasons otherwise excellent candidates never hear back:

- Their CV reads like a teaching résumé, not an operational leadership document.
- The language in their cover letter is focused on students and pedagogy instead of strategic goals and outcomes.
- They underestimate how competitive these roles are — many are internal searches or invitation-based.
- They have no clear, demonstrated experience with compliance, conflict resolution, curriculum oversight, data-driven decision-making, or team leadership.

Most applicants are only one well-written document away from being taken seriously. But that document has to tell the right story.

## What Hiring Committees Are Really Looking For

The jump from the classroom to the administrative office isn’t about your course evaluations anymore. Here’s what deans and provosts look for when hiring for leadership roles:

- Strategic Thinking: Have you demonstrated the ability to align academic programs with institutional goals?
- Oversight & Operational Experience: Have you supervised faculty, managed budgets, dealt with scheduling, or handled course rotations?
- Accreditation & Compliance Awareness: Can you speak the language of regional accrediting bodies or internal policy governance?
- Oversight & Operational Experience: Have you supervised faculty, managed budgets, dealt with scheduling, or handled course rotations?
- Conflict Resolution: Have you resolved disputes, addressed student complaints, or mediated peer-to-peer issues?
- Initiative: Have you led committees, launched programs, or initiated change at your institution?

They aren’t just looking for a good teacher with “leadership potential.” They’re hiring someone who can manage people, solve problems, and execute strategy — often under pressure and political complexity.

## Step 1: Rewriting Your CV for Administration

Let’s be clear: your current CV, no matter how polished, was likely written to land teaching positions. It’s time to evolve it.

### Remove:

- Long lists of courses taught with course numbers
- Bulleted responsibilities that read like a job description
- Outdated sections like “Educator Attributes” or philosophy that only speaks to classroom goals
- eaching-focused outcomes (like student engagement tools) without context for leadership roles

### Add:

- Administrative achievements (even informal ones) — think: led faculty committees, coordinated accreditation responses, managed adjunct faculty
- Key phrases aligned with leadership: academic operations, student retention, budgeting, policy compliance, conflict resolution, institutional effectiveness
- Clear sections for:
  - Leadership Experience
  - Program Oversight
  - Strategic Initiatives
  - Faculty Supervision
  - Instructional Design & Curriculum Development

A 2026-ready CV for administration is narrative-driven, impact-oriented, and operational in tone. It’s not just “here’s what I did,” but “here’s the institutional value I added.”

## Step 2: Retooling Your Cover Letter

Most applicants still write cover letters that focus on teaching, student relationships, or their love of
higher education. That’s not enough.

Your cover letter should:

- Be addressed to a specific dean, chair, or provost (and yes, we write those for our clients at
Faculty Job Tools)
- Open with a clear statement of leadership philosophy, not teaching philosophy
- Tie your background to institutional strategy, accreditation cycles, enrollment pressures, or
retention goals
- Include measurable accomplishments, even if they’re soft data (e.g., improved adjunct onboarding,
reduced student complaints, implemented conflict resolution model)

Hiring committees want to see that you understand the bigger picture. Your cover letter is the place to show it.

## Step 3: Bridging Your Teaching Background to Leadership

This is where most faculty struggle. You’ve been teaching for years — but how do you make that feel like
administrative experience?

We help our clients translate these line by line, paragraph by paragraph — so that hiring committees see
you as a peer, not just a classroom instructor trying to “move up.”

## Step 4: Choosing the Right Roles to Apply For

Not every admin job is the right fit for every faculty candidate. At Faculty Job Tools, we help clients assess:

- Is this a full administrative role or hybrid (e.g., 50% teaching, 50% ops)?
- Is it centralized administration or department-based?
- What’s the leadership structure and span of control?
- Is this the right first step, or should you apply for an interim, assistant, or internal coordinator
role first?

We often guide faculty toward roles like:

- Assistant/Associate Chair
- Program Director
- Online Division Coordinator
- Faculty Development Lead
- Instructional Quality Reviewer
- Director of Curriculum and Instruction

Many of these positions are stepping stones to dean, provost, or VPAA — and they require a strategy just like full-time roles do.

## Step 5: Reaching Out Strategically

One of the most underused — but most effective — tactics in transitioning into academic leadership is
intentional outreach.

That’s why we help clients:

- Craft custom messages to send to hiring deans and chairs at institutions of their choice
- Position themselves for future openings before they go live
- Build credibility through thoughtful introduction emails, especially for leadership-track roles

You don’t need to wait for a job posting to appear. At the leadership level, many positions are filled internally or by invitation. You can — and should — start that conversation first.

## Step 6: Targeting the Right Institutions

You may be leadership-ready — but are you applying where you’re most likely to be hired?

At Faculty Job Tools, we evaluate the hiring patterns, academic models, and leadership needs of:

- Private nonprofit universities
- Regional comprehensives
- Faith-based institutions
- Online and adult-focused colleges
- Community colleges expanding online leadership

We also research what their programs look like, how fast they’re growing, and which departments are
seeing turnover.

That’s how we build your custom job search — not with guesswork or job alerts, but real data.

## Step 7: Letting Us Apply for You (Yes, Really)

Faculty clients are busy. That’s why we don’t just give you leads — we can apply on your behalf.

Here’s how it works:

- You tell us your goals, parameters, availability, and preferences.
- We search for matches (including roles you won’t find on major boards).
- We revise your CV, write custom letters, and tailor every application.
- We apply — for you.

We also send follow-up messages to deans and provosts when appropriate, increasing your visibility even
before interviews.

For those transitioning into leadership, this support is often the difference between staying stuck in
the classroom and moving into a role with impact.

## Why Faculty Job Tools Is Built for This

We aren’t a resume factory or AI-driven job scraper.

We’re a team of real people who work in higher education, many of whom have chaired hiring committees,
served in academic administration, and designed curriculum for national online universities.

We’ve helped thousands of faculty get hired — and increasingly, we’re helping them step into
leadership.

If that’s your next move, let us help you do it right.

Description: What happens in a faculty job interview? Learn how to prepare, what questions to expect, and how to impress search committees.

_By Dani Babb, PhD \| Helping Professors Find Jobs for 25 Years_

## Introduction: Why Faculty Interviews Are Unlike Any Other

Faculty job interviews aren’t just about answering questions—they’re about demonstrating your educational philosophy, student-centered mindset, and institutional fit.

Whether you’re aiming for an online adjunct role or a tenure-track position, academic interviews involve far more than just proving you’re qualified. You’re being assessed on:

- How well you understand teaching and learning in today’s higher education landscape
- Your alignment with the institution’s mission, values, and student body
- Your ability to clearly communicate your teaching practices, research agenda, or leadership philosophy

Unfortunately, most applicants—even seasoned professors—walk into interviews thinking like job candidates, not like educators stepping into a community.

Let’s break down what really happens in these interviews, what hiring teams are looking for, and how you can prepare.

## Common Faculty Interview Formats

Unlike traditional corporate hiring, academic hiring processes often include multiple rounds of evaluation and a variety of interview formats, including:

- Phone screenings or recorded video interviews to assess basic fit and availability
- Panel interviews with faculty, department chairs, and HR
- Teaching demonstrations—live or pre-recorded—to evaluate instructional skill
- Open forums with students or other faculty members
- Mission-alignment interviews, especially at faith-based or DEI-focused institutions

Each of these requires a different type of preparation. For example, teaching demonstrations demand clarity, energy, and adaptability, while panel interviews require you to read the room and balance your answers across multiple perspectives.

## What They’re Really Listening For

Yes, interviewers want to know about your degrees, your subject-matter expertise, and your experience. But beyond that, they’re paying attention to your:

- Student engagement strategies (especially in asynchronous or remote learning)
- Understanding of assessment, equity, and accessibility
- Willingness to collaborate with other faculty and take part in curriculum development
- Ability to navigate technology platforms like Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, or Brightspace
- Familiarity with adult learners, first-gen students, or underserved populations

Faculty interviews are not only about what you teach—but how and why you teach the way you do.

## Where Candidates Often Struggle

From 25 years of preparing professors for academic interviews, here’s where we see the most common gaps:

- Vague answers to questions like “How do you handle student engagement?” or “How do you know your students are learning?”
- Overly corporate phrasing when transitioning from private sector to teaching
- Not knowing how to discuss assessment, accessibility, or diversity and inclusion
- Underselling or miscommunicating online teaching experience
- Rambling answers with no clear takeaway

Practice matters—and rehearsing with someone who knows what the institution is actually trying to evaluate can help you avoid these missteps.

## How to Prepare: Practical Steps You Can Take Now

Here’s how you can begin preparing more effectively for academic interviews:

1. Study the institution’s mission and student population

Be ready to explain how your teaching aligns with their values.
2. Create short, specific stories from your teaching, mentoring, or curriculum design experience.
3. Be ready to speak to both traditional and non-traditional learners, especially if the school serves working adults or online students.
4. Develop clear answers for questions like:

   - “How do you handle a disengaged student?”
   - “Describe how you build community in an online course.”
   - “How do you assess learning outcomes in your classes?”

6. Record yourself answering questions to catch filler words or overly technical language.
7. Work with a coach or peer who understands the current academic landscape.

## Why Interview Coaching Still Matters—Even for Experienced Faculty

Even seasoned educators benefit from interview coaching. Why? Because knowing your subject matter isn’t the same as knowing how to talk about it strategically in a high-stakes interview.

Our coaching is built specifically for academic roles, with feedback from real faculty hiring committee members. We help you:

- Practice live answers with real-time feedback
- Clarify your teaching and leadership philosophy
- Strengthen your examples so they reflect student impact
- Tackle difficult questions or red flags (career changes, gaps, tech hesitance)

We don’t script you—we help you sound like yourself, only more prepared and confident.

## Final Thoughts: This Is Your Classroom Before You Get the Job

A faculty interview is your first chance to teach. Even when you’re not delivering a formal lesson, you’re still communicating how you approach education, connect with students, and think critically about learning.

Treat the interview like your classroom. Be clear. Be present. Be prepared.

## Want Help Preparing?

At Faculty Job Tools, we offer customized interview coaching for educators applying to online, hybrid, or on-campus teaching roles. If you want to polish your delivery, anticipate tough questions, or practice with someone who’s actually been on a faculty search committee—we’re here to help.

## Page 11: How to Write a Cover Letter That Actually Lands Faculty Interviews – Faculty Job Tools
URL: https://facultyjobtools.com/blogs/news/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-that-actually-lands-faculty-interviews
Date: 2026-02-03
Description: A strong faculty cover letter can make or break your application. Learn how to write an academic cover letter that gets you more faculty interviews.

_Dani Babb, PhD \| A Babb Education Company_

_Helping Professors Find Jobs for 25 Years_

Your CV tells the story of your academic achievements, but your cover letter is the voice behind it—it’s where you speak
directly to the search committee. And yet, most faculty job seekers fall into the same traps: vague introductions, generic
templates, or long-winded personal statements that say little about why they’re a fit for this role at this institution.

## Let’s fix that.

This article walks through how to structure and write your faculty cover letter in 2025 and beyond. The guidance here is
based on thousands of successful letters we’ve written at Faculty Job Tools and feedback we’ve collected from real hiring
committees.

## What’s the Purpose of a Faculty Cover Letter?

Your cover letter should introduce you as a compelling candidate, demonstrate a clear understanding of the institution’s
mission, and explain why you are a strong fit—not just as a scholar, but as a teacher, mentor, and contributor to the
department.

It’s not a biography or a copy of your CV. It’s a persuasive, targeted letter that connects your qualifications to their needs.

## How Long Should It Be?

One page, single spaced. Three to five paragraphs. Don’t shrink the font or the margins—tighten the message instead.

## Proven Structure to Use

**Opening Paragraph: Say what you’re applying for.**

State the job title and where you saw the ad. Mention the institution by name. Express enthusiasm and alignment with
their mission.

Example: I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor of Psychology at XYZ University, as advertised on
HigherEdJobs. With a deep commitment to advancing inclusive, research-informed instruction, I see this opportunity as an
ideal match for my academic and teaching philosophy.

## Second Paragraph: Why you?

Summarize your qualifications—teaching experience, research areas, instructional modalities, credentials. Focus on your
most relevant highlights. Avoid simply repeating your CV. Instead, explain how your experience aligns with what they
need.

## Third Paragraph: Why them?

Hiring committees want to know you’ve done your homework. Mention something specific about the institution: a program,
value, or initiative. Connect your values and teaching style to their mission or student population.

Avoid pasting in their mission statement. Be genuine.

## Optional Fourth Paragraph: Teaching or research insight.

If space allows, share a short paragraph about how you teach or your research goals. What is your approach to student
engagement? What is your research agenda and how does it complement their department?

## Closing Paragraph: Finish strong.

Reaffirm your interest. State that your CV and other materials are included. Indicate you’re open to an interview.

Example: I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and values align with the goals of the Department of
Sociology. I have attached my CV and would be happy to provide additional materials upon request.

## Tips to Help You Stand Out

Tailor every letter, even a little bit. Hiring committees can spot a generic letter immediately. Ditto with ChatGPT.

Keep it professional. Avoid clichés or overly casual phrases.

Use formatting that’s clean and simple. One font, standard margins, no photos.

Include keywords from the job description. This shows alignment and can help if screening software is used.

Don’t restate your CV. Provide context and connection.

## What Hiring Committees Want to See

Fit with their mission.

Clear teaching and research goals.

Ability to support and relate to their student population.

Strong communication and collaboration potential.

Evidence of growth and reflection.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Writing only about yourself, with no connection to their institution.

Using vague, flowery language instead of concrete examples.

Recycling a teaching philosophy without customizing it.

Starting every sentence with “I”.

Ignoring what the institution values or needs.

Remember: Your Cover Letter is the First Filter

Your application might be one of hundreds. The cover letter is often the first chance to show you “get it”—that you

understand the school, the job, and the expectations. Done well, it can earn you an interview even before your CV is fully
reviewed.

# Academic Resume - Curriculum Vitae

This new process is shaped by years of experience and real-time input from hiring deans, program directors, and academic hiring managers.

Your CV will be:

- Rich with the right keywords to pass applicant tracking systems and auto-screening filters.

- Concise, current, and aligned with how committees review applications today.

- Professionally formatted without unnecessary graphics or design elements that risk bias concerns.

- Structured to highlight your teaching impact, subject expertise, and commitment to student success — even if you’re new to higher education.

Each CV is written collaboratively through an iterative process between you and our team, with direct involvement from Dr. Babb, author of the first two Make Money Teaching Online books — the original guides to breaking into higher education teaching. We also include a carefully written teaching philosophy statement that can stand alone for uploads or be integrated into your CV.

There’s no one-size-fits-all academic CV anymore. Ours are built from real-world research, feedback from hiring leaders, and decades of proven results — helping faculty present themselves authentically, professionally, and powerfully in today’s higher education marketplace.

# Tusculum University

I give Dr. Babb and her team at Doctorally my highest recommendation!

I found myself in a very difficult position. I reached out Dr. Babb and her team and they came to the rescue and saved our semester. Due to budgetary reasons we had to let half of our departmental faculty go, which included all our online professors. Our dean moved on and I was asked to step in and save our upcoming semester. I had to find highly qualified and credentialled adjuncts to replace the professors we let go, and we had to develop new curricula for all the courses our former professors taught. We already had students enrolled in more than 20 online courses which now had no professors or curriculum.

I contacted Dr. Babb knowing her work and we had a team of adjuncts in place exactly on time. She and her team worked tirelessly to meet the deadline. Our semester has gone very smoothly, and the student response to our new adjuncts and courses has been very positive.

Dr. Babb and her team not only provided a great product but were exceptionally easy to work with. Email responses were typically within minutes, and pricing was very reasonable.

Please feel free to contact me with any further questions.

Sincerely,

Dr. Kevin M. Hill

Interim Dean of the College of Business
